This is the source code to Boris' Visual Chronology of Science & Discovery. Here is a
[demo of the visualization][demo], and [more information about the project][blog].

So far, the visualization covers the period up to 1850 CE according to
[Asimov's book][book]. The next step in the project is to summarize the contents
of the book from 1850 CE onward.

- If there's an issue with the visualization or text you'd like addressed, please submit
  a [GH issue][issue].

If you have questions, please [email me][email]
