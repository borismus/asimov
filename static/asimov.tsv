calculating-machines	1693	Calculating machines	Built the Step Reckoner, a mechanical aid to calculation of trig and astronomical tables.	Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz	Germany	adding-machine	Math		
mortality-tables	1693	Mortality tables	Halley produced a life table showing the number of people surviving to any age from a cohort born the same year.	Edmond Halley	England	probability	Math		
miners-friend	1698	Miner's friend	Miner's Friend invented to pump water out of flooded mines. Steam-powered air pump to help English coal mining, which was increasingly relied upon because of shortage of wood.	Thomas Savery	England	air-pump, coal-mining	Science		
scientific-voyages	1698	Scientific ocean voyages	First ocean voyage exclusively for science. Prior, voyages were taken for exploration, settlement or trade, with science as a side-effect. Halley's voyage measured magnetic declinations around the world, prepared first map of the world showing isodeclination, and accurate lat/long for ports.	Edmond Halley	England	india-water-route	Science		
gas-volume-temperature	1699	Gas volume temperature	Discovery that volume of gas proportional to temperature. A step towards gas laws, but not quite precise enough measurements yet.	Guillaume Amontons	France	air-pressure	Science		
binary-system	1700	Binary system	First use of non-decimal bases (2, 8, 12). A binary number is a number expressed in base 2, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1.	Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz	Germany	decimal-notation	Math		
comet-orbits	1705	Comets' Orbits	Comet orbits remained mysterious. Halley claimed that comet orbits were elliptical, just very elongated. At the time, he was not taken seriously, but when he successfully predicted the return of a comet 50 years later, he was vindicated posthumously.	Edmund Halley	England	comet-distance,laws-motion	Space		
plant-nourishment	1705	Plant Nourishment	Discovery that air contributed to the nourishment of plants, not just water. Also the first to collect gas by bubbling them through water and trapping in an inverted vessel.	Stephen Hales	England	gas	Science:Chemistry		
carriage-springs	1706	Carriage springs	Up to now, passengers of all wheeled vehicles were jolted by every road imperfection. Springs helped to absorb some of them, at the expense of swaying.			paved-road,steel	Culture		
static-electricity-improved	1706	Improved static generator	Greatly improved upon Guericke's static electricity generator by constructing a glass sphere turned by a crank that used friction to generate electricity. Led to more experiments with static electricity.	Francis Hauksbee	England	static-electricity	Science:Physics		
pulse-watch	1707	Pulse watch	By now clocks could tell time to the nearest minute, so minute hands were added to clocks in the late 17th century. Floyer invented a device which when wound would run for exactly 60 seconds. This allowed to calculate heart rate for the first time!	John Floyer	England	pendulum-clock, hand-watch	Science:Biology		
coke-iron	1709	Coke and iron	Iron smelting required high temperatures previously only attainable by burning coal. But coal was becoming increasingly expensive as English forests continued to recede. Coke turns out to be even more effective for smelting iron and could be done at higher temperatures and larger scale.	Abraham Darby	England	mineralogy, steel	Science		
rifle	1710	Rifle	If a gun barrel is outfitted with spiral grooves ("rifled"), the bullet will spin around its axis and aim better, but this requires better gun construction. The new Pennsylvania rifle took twice as long to reload but had triple the range.		America	musket	War		
newcomen-steam-engine	1712	Newcomen steam engine	The demand for coal was increasing, so were coal mining operations, and the need to pump water out of mines. Newcomen invented a new type of steam engine that could use lower pressure steam and was safer than Savery's Miner's Friend. Still very inefficient.	Thomas Newcomen	England	coke-iron,miners-friend	General		
smallpox-vaccine	1713	Smallpox inoculation	Smallpox was highly contagious and deadly, and left survivors disfigured with pockmarks. But the disease didn't recur in the same person. In Turkey, some began deliberately spreading mild cases of the disease through pus, but this was fraught.	Mary Wortley Montagu	England	epilepsy	Science:Biology		
mercury-thermometer	1714	Mercury thermometer	Ferdinand II de Medici was first to invent a closed thermometer (immune from effects of pressure), but used water or alcohol which didn't expand evenly with temperature. Fahrenheit made the switch to Mercury to remedy this. The scale is named after him, which starts at 0 because it was the coldest temperature he could create.	Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit	Germany	gas-volume-temperature,thermometer	Science:Physics		
solar-eclipse	1715	Solar eclipse	23 centuries prior, Thales predicted the eclipse which happened on April 22, 1715. Halley plotted the path of the eclipse and organized a number of observers to watch the eclipse.	Edmond Halley	England	eclipse, reflecting-telescope	Space		
stellar-motion	1718	Stellar motion	Up to now, it had been assumed that the stars were fixed in the sky. However, upon careful observation of bright stars Sirius, Procyon, and Arcturus, Halley found that they'd moved relative to the observations of Tycho.	Edmond Halley	England	supernova	Space		
easter-island	1722	Easter Island	Just 45 square miles in area, and 1200 miles from nearest land (a small island), likely the farthest point reached by the Polynesians. Roggeveen also discovered the Samoan Islands.	Jacob Roggeveen	Netherlands	around-earth	Geography		
longitude	1728	Ship’s chronometer	A ship's latitude (declination from equator) can be determined from the position of the sun or north star. But to measure longitude, you need to know time. Pendulums clocks don't work on swaying ships. Spurred by a large prize from the British government, Harrison built highly accurate sea clocks.	John Harrison	England	pendulum-clock,ocean-navigation	General		
aberration-light	1728	Aberration of light	Since heliocentricity, astronomers tried to see parallax in the stars as a result of the earth moving around the sun (186 million miles displacement). Rather than finding this parallax, Bradley ooked through a 212ft long telescope and found he had to tip the scope to catch the light as the earth moved, and unlocked a new way to calculate the speed of light.	James Bradley	England	comet-distance, speed-of-light	Science:Physics		
bering-strait	1728	Bering Strait	Peter I commissioned Bering, a Dutch navigator to explore far reaches of eastern Russia. He first mapped Kamchatka and then sailed north and reached the arctic ice without sighting land, continuing through the Bering Strait. This was definitive proof that North America was not part of Asia.	Vitus Jonassen Bering	Russia	new-world	Geography		
dentistry	1728	Dentistry	The first book entirely devoted to Dentistry was "Le chirurgien dentiste", discussing artificial dentures, crowns, how to treat cavities with metal fillings. Fauchard is considered the father of dentistry.	Pierre Fauchard	France	anatomy	Science:Biology		
electrical-conductance	1729	Electrical conductance	When he electrified a long glass tube, corks on both ends were electrified despite not having been touched. He tried this with other mediums, like 800ft long twine, and found that "electrical fluid" traveled through some mediums (conductors) better than others (insulators).	Stephen Gray	England	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics		
achromatic-lens	1733	Achromatic lens	Different kinds of glass produce spectra of different widths. Flint glass (contains lead) produced wider spectrum than crown (regular) glass. By combining a convex lens out of crown, and a concave lens out of flint glass, he made a lens that magnified without producing colors.	Chester Moor Hall	England	light-spectrum, concave-lenses	Science:Physics		
blood-pressure	1733	Blood pressure	Hales went from studying the flow of sap in plants to the flow of blood in animals, measuring rates of flow in different parts of the circulatory system. He wrote Hemostaticks in 1733.	Stephen Hales	England	plant-nourishment	Science:Biology		
positive-negative-charge	1733	Positive and negative charge	While studying static electricity, du Fay found that if you electrify two objects using different means (one by glass rod -- "vitreous", one by resin rod -- "resinous"), you can have them attract one another. He suggested two different kinds of electrical fluids.	Charles-Francois de Cisternay du Fay	France	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics		
flying-shuttle	1733	Flying shuttle	In weaving, a shuttle with yarn (weft) criss-crosses stationary yarn (warp), forming a lattice. Kay invented the flying shuttle, which enabled the weaver to pull the shuttle by means of two cords, greatly accelerating the process.	John Kay	England	laws-motion	Science:Physics		
shape-of-earth-confirmed	1735	Shape of the Earth	If the earth was the shape Newton suggested it was, a degree of latitude near the poles should be greater in mileage than at the equator. One explorer went to the equator (Peru), the other to the north pole (Lapland), confirming Newton. Sea level at equator is 13 miles farther from center than sea level at poles.	Charles Marie de la Condamine / Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis	France	shape-of-earth	Geography		
taxonomy	1735	Taxonomy	Linnaeus traveled over 4600 miles through northern Scandinavia, discovering hundreds of new plant species. He referred to each plant by genus and species (eg. Homo sapiens), the binomial nomenclature we still use today. And invented the taxonomy of classes, orders.	Carl von Linne	Sweden	plant-species-classified	Science:Biology		
trade-winds	1735	Trade winds	Hadley found that air near the equator had a faster west-to-east motion than air farther from it. This is due to the uneven heating of the earth due to the sun: hotter at the equator, cooler at poles, and the coriolis effect. Today this model is called the Hadley cell.	George Hadley	England	meteorological-map	Science:Physics		
mechanics	1736	Mechanics	Newton's principia featured geometric proofs of his claims. Euler wrote "Mechanics", and provided proofs using algebra and calculus.	Leonhard Euler	Switzerland	laws-motion	Science:Physics		
cobalt	1737	Cobalt	Miners were puzzled at some varieties of copper ore which didn't yield copper when smelted, and suspected foul play from kobolds, a type of mythical sprite. Upon closer examination, it was a new element (after Phosphorus), and Brandt named it cobalt. This was the first metal to be discovered not known to the medeival alchemists.	Georg Brandt	Sweden	phosphorus	Science:Chemistry		
kinetic-gases	1738	Kinetic theory of gases	Bernoulli modeled gas as many small particles in rapid movement, with temperature increasing their speed. As a result, increasing temperature increases volume (keeping pressure the same). Similarly, increasing temperature increases pressure if volume is kept fixed.	Daniel Bernoulli	Switzerland	boyles-law	Science:Physics		
rocky-mountains	1739	Rocky Mountains	The French continued their exploration of North America, with brother Pierre and Paul Mallet reaching Colorado and becoming the first Europeans to see the Rockies.	Pierre and Paul Mallet	France	america	Geography		
hydra	1740	Hydra	Trembley discovered the hydra, a small primitive organism resembling a plant, but actually an animal. It's tiny tentacles resembled the formidable Hydra destroyed by Hercules. And this hydra could regenerate parts that were cut off, as well as merge with other hydras to become one organism.	Abraham Trembley	Switzerland	plant-species-classified, animal-classification-improved	Science:Biology		
celsius	1742	Celsius scale	The Fahrenheit scale was commonly used, but phase changes were set at awkward quantities: melting at 32 F and boiling at 212 F. Celsius rationalized this by setting them to 0 and 100 respectively.	Anders Celsius	Sweden	mercury-thermometer	Science:Physics		
goldbach	1742	Goldbach’s conjecture	Working in Russia, German mathematician formulated a conjecture, still unproven: "Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."	Christian Goldbach	Russia	arab-numbers	Math		
franklin-stove	1742	Franklin stove	Fires in confined areas cause a lot of smoke, and chimneys allow hot air from the fire to escape immediately. Rather than creating a draft, Franklin devised a stove that would heat up the metal of the stove and let the air escape much more slowly. Initially it sold poorly, but David Rittenhouse made significant improvements.	Benjamin Franklin	America	fire,boyles-law	General		
transcendental-numbers	1744	Transcendental numbers	In mathematics, a transcendental number is a complex number that is not an algebraic number—that is, not a root (i.e., solution) of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. The best-known transcendental numbers are π and e.	Leonhard Euler	Switzerland	imaginary-numbers	Math		
leyden-jar	1745	Leyden jar	A Leyden jar stores a high-voltage electric charge (from an external source) between electrical conductors on the inside and outside of a glass jar. This was an improvement over Hauksbee's glass sphere, and gave its inventor a major shock. The same device was independently invented by a German physicist von Kleist. Named after the inventor's University of Leiden.	Peter van Musschenbroek	Netherlands	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics		
blood-and-iron	1745	Blood and iron	The chemical composition of blood was completely unknown until an experimenter fed iron to dogs to see if the iron would be incorporated in the blood. As a control, he checked the composition of regular dog blood and found that it already contained iron, specifically in red blood cells.	Vincenzo Menghini	Italy	red-blood-cells	Science:Biology		
scurvy	1747	Scurvy	More men were disabled by scurvy on long sea voyages than by any other cause. Lind served in the navy and knew how monotonous the diet was, and also knew that scurvy also appeared in other such environments (prisons, under siege). He studied the effect of fruits on scurvy and found citrus provided great relief.	James Lind	England	india-water-route	Science:Biology		
osmosis	1748	Osmosis	Intuitively, if a liquid can soak through a solid, it should be able to seep through in any direction. Nollet found that you can have semipermeable membranes that allow one type of liquid but not another. Thus enables unidirectional fluid flow.	Jean Antoine Nollet	France	hydrostatics	Science:Physics		
platinum	1749	Platinum	Existence of platnium was generally unknown since it is as rare as gold, but lacks its ostentatious beauty. It was scientifically studied by Ulloa, who found it to be denser than gold, higher melting and less reactive.	Antonio de Ulloa	Spain	steel	Science:Chemistry		
biological-evolution	1749	Biological evolution	Buffon was the first to speculate openly about evolution in a book called "Natural History", where he imagined an evolution in reverse: apes as degenerate humans, donkeys as degenerate horses, jackals as degenerate wolves. He was wrong, but it implied that species could change over time.	Louis Leclerc de Buffon	France	taxonomy	Science:Biology		
formation-earth	1749	Formation of the Earth	Buffon thought that there may have been a natural (not God) cause to Earth's creation, such as the collision of the Sun with a comet. He also estimated Earth's age by calculating how long it would take an Earth-sized object to cool from the temperature of the sun. His estimates of 75,000 years were wrong, but this was much greater than 6000.	Louis Leclerc de Buffon	France	comet-distance,biblical-age-of-earth	Space		
nickel	1751	Nickel	Cronstedt studied under Brandt, who isolated cobalt, and isolated another metal from ore that was neither copper nor cobalt. Colloquially known as kupfernickel by miners, he dubbed it nickel for short. Turned out nickel was also magnetic but weaker than iron.	Axel Fredrick Cronstedt	Sweden	cobalt	Science:Chemistry		
encyclopedia	1751	Encyclopedia	Diderot compiled a multivolume summary of all knowledge for the general public, with alphabetical entries. This was fitting at a time that called itself the Age of Reason.	Denis Diderot	France	printing-press	General		
lightning-rod	1752	Lightning rod	Franklin coined the terms "positive" and "negative" charge, rejecting du Fay's notion of two kinds of electrical fluids. He imagined that during a lightning strike, the earth and sky form a gigantic Leyden jar and flew a kite in a thunderstorm and found that the silk thread showed signs of electrical charge. He was also able to charge a real Leyden jar using this energy, proving that the two electricities were identical. Franklin generalized this idea and built tall metal spires on top of buildings, which averted lightning-induced fires, the first mitigation of natural disaster through science.	Benjamin Franklin	America	leyden-jar,positive-negative-charge	Science:Physics		
digestion	1752	Digestion	Up to now, there was debate whether digestion was chemical or mechanical in nature. In an experiment on hawks and dogs, Reaumur showed that it had to be both. Thus in addition to behaving like a mechanical machine, the body also has a chemical aspect.	Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur	France	muscles-bones, metabolism	Science:Biology		
earth-heat	1752	Earth and heat	Most Europeans up to now attributed changes to the Earth's surface to forces of water (called Neptunists). However Guettard challenged this after observing that rocks experienced great changes in temperature in the past.	Etienne Guettard	France	water-element,formation-earth	Science:Geology		
carbon-dioxide	1754	Carbon dioxide	Up to now, carbon dioxide had only been detected as a product of combustion or fermentation. Black described how to create a gas by heating limestone, calling it "fixed air" because it could be fixed back into a solid by combining with lime. He also found that calcium oxide turned into calcium carbonate naturally in the air, so there must be carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.	Joseph Black	Scotland	gas	Science:Chemistry		
galaxy	1755	Galaxy	Are the stars in the sky uniformly distributed, or are they contained in some particular shape? Based on the Milky Way, it seems like the latter. Kant suggested that the Sun was one of many stars in a lens-like shape, and that the Milky Way was what we see when we look along the long axis of the lens. He suggested that there were other galaxies, but this all remained unproven.	Immanuel Kant	Germany	reflecting-telescope	Space		
land-bridges	1756	Land bridges	It was so far assumed that the shape of the continents was fixed and eternal, but Desmarest pointed out similarities of the shores across the English channel, suggesting that the two land masses drifted apart over time. He incorrectly believed these changes were caused by earthquakes.	Nicolas Desmarest	France	sea-navigation	Science:Geology		
halley-comet	1758	Halley's comet	Halley predicted that the comet of 1682 would return in 1758. Amateur astronomer spotted it on Dec 25, 1758. Retrospectively, it turned out that this was the same comet seen by William the Conqueror, and the same one painted by Giotto.	Johann Georg Palitzsch	England	comet-orbits	Space		
flame-tests	1758	Flame tests	It was a difficult task for chemists to distinguish one substance from another. For example, sodium and potassium look similar, but they burn yellow and violet respectively. Further improving the process, Cronstedt introduced a blowpipe which directed a jet of air, making more granular temperature possible.	Andreas Sigismund Marggraf	Germany	nickel	Science:Chemistry		
embryology	1759	Embryology	At the time, it was customary to think that seeds, eggs, pollen, sperm, etc, had miniature organisms in them that grew. Some thought that this was recursive! Wolff found that specialized organs developed out of unspecialized tissue.	Kaspar Friedrich Wolff	Germany	plant-sexuality	Science:Biology		
earthquakes	1760	Earthquakes	Early theories attributed earthquakes to relentless gods or pent-up air underground. The Lisbon quake of 1755 forced more scientifict hinking. Mitchell noted that quakes often correlated to volcanic areas, thought underground water was boiled by volcanic heat, and caused circular waves from the epicenter. Mitchell is considered founder of seismology.	John Mitchell	England	earth-heat	Science:Geology		
heat-capacity	1760	Heat capacity	Heat was considered a special fluid which filled all substances equally based on weight. Black showed that when heating equal weights of mercury and water, mercury's temperature went up twice as fast as the water temperature did.	Joseph Black	Scotland	five-elements, mercury-thermometer	Science:Chemistry		
pathology	1760	Pathology	Morgagni published a list of 640 postmortems fully detailing the lives of his patience, development of disease and manner of death from the anatomical point of view.	Giovanni Battista Morgagni	Italy	cadaver	Science:Biology		
venus-atmosphere	1761	Venus’s atmosphere	Venus didn't appear to have any visual features except when passing directly between sun and earth (called transit of Venus). In an attempt to study Venus' parallax, an expedition was setup to observe it from many different places on earth. This effort failed because the time when venus entered and left the solar shadow could not be determined accurately. Lomonosov suggested this might be due to fuzziness caused by an atmosphere, and was right!	Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov	Russia	reflecting-telescope	Space		
percussion	1761	Medical percussion	Percussion is a method of tapping on a surface to determine the underlying structures, and is used in clinical examinations to assess the condition of the thorax or abdomen.	Leopold Auenbrugger von Auenbrug	Austria	muscles-bones	Science		
latent-heat	1762	Latent heat	Discovery that heat can be absorbed by ice without raising its temperature, leading to the concept of latent heat.	Joseph Black	Scotland	heat-capacity	Science

steam-engine	1764	Steam engine	James Watt repaired and improved a Newcomen steam engine, leading to the first reasonably efficient steam engine. He devised a method for keeping one chamber always hot and another always cold, utilizing latent heat more efficiently, which paved the way for the first truly efficient steam engine.	James Watt	Scotland	latent-heat, newcomen-steam-engine	Science		
plutonism	1765	Plutonism	Nicolas Desmarest suggested that valleys were formed by streams that ran through them, influenced by the heat from volcanic activity.	Nicolas Desmarest	France	earth-heat	Science		
hydrogen	1766	Hydrogen	Demarest discovered hydrogen (which he called 'fire air') through its properties, specifically its high flammability and low density, being one-fourteenth the density of air. His detailed studies on hydrogen's properties led to its eventual recognition as a distinct element.	Henry Cavendish	England	chemical-elements	Science		
experiments-on-nerves	1766	Experiments on nerves	Albrecht von Haller conducted experiments that led to the conclusion of nerves being responsible for muscle movement, not a fluid transmitted through nerves. Haller’s work laid the foundations for modern neurology.	Albrecht von Haller	Switzerland	cadaver	Science		
no-spontaneous-generation-redux	1768	Definitely no spontaneous generation	Lazzaro Spallanzani's experiment further challenged the idea of spontaneous generation by showing no new microorganisms appeared in broth after thoroughly boiling and sealing it.	Lazzaro Spallanzani	Italy	no-spontaneous-generation	Science		
carbonated-water	1768	Carbonated water	Joseph Priestley discovered how to infuse water with carbon dioxide to create carbonated water. This discovery led to the foundation of the soft drink industry.	Joseph Priestley	England	fermentation, carbon-dioxide	General		
quantitative-chemistry	1769	Quantitative chemistry	Lavoisier boiled water for 101 days, observing that sediment appeared and the water did not change its weight, refuting the Greek theory that water could be converted into earth. His precise, quantitative method provided clearer understanding and marked a significant advance in the field of chemistry.	Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier	France	latent-heat	Science		
spinning-frame	1769	Spinning frame	The spinning frame was a mechanical device that could produce strong and hard cotton threads quickly enough to meet the demands of the booming textile industry. His invention made cotton manufacturing faster and more cost-effective, requiring relatively unskilled workers and little money	Richard Arkwright	England	mechanics, flying-shuttle	Design		
nile-river	1770	Nile river	Bruce journeyed upstream to Khartoum in Sudan where he determined the confluence of the White Nile from the southwest and the Blue Nile from the southeast, identifying its source to Ethiopia, which was previously unknown to European explorers.	James Bruce	Scotland		Geography		
gulf-stream	1770	Gulf stream	Franklin, after traveling from America to Europe multiple times, became aware of the difference in eastward and westward sailing times due to ocean currents. He produced a map of the Gulf Stream, beginning of the scientific study of ocean currents.	Benjamin Franklin	England	ocean-navigation	Geography		
soluble-gases	1770	Soluble gases	Priestley became the first person to infuse gases such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride into an upside-down mercury-filled vessel, allowing for the collection of gases that could not be captured through water because they dissolve in water.	Joseph Priestley	England	gas	Science		
nebulas	1771	Nebulas	Initially frustrated by his findings of fuzzy objects that were not comets but rather "nebulosities" fixed in space, he compiled a list of these objects. This list of nebulas includes many star clusters and distant galaxies.	Charles Messier	France	reflecting-telescope, andromeda-nebula	Science		
plants-and-carbon-dioxide	1771	Plants and carbon dioxide	Carbon dioxide was understood to support the respiration of plants, with the notable experiment involving a plant surviving in carbon dioxide-rich air.	Joseph Priestley	England	carbon-dioxide	Science		
combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	1772	Combustion and phlogiston	Chemists of the time thought combustible items contained a substance called phlogiston, from a Greek word meaning 'to set on fire.' Lavoisier began weighing objects in closed volumes and evaluating the volume and weight before and after combustion, refuting the idea that phlogiston was lost and moving towards the understanding of oxygen and its role in combustion.	Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier	France	five-elements	Science		
diamond	1772	Diamond	Antoine Lavoisier burned diamond and observed it in a closed vessel, proving that it was a form of Carbon. He indicated that when it grew hot enough, it simply disappeared, contributing to disprove the phlogiston theory.	Antoine Lavoisier	France	combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	Science		
nitrogen	1772	Nitrogen	Daniel Rutherford asked a question regarding what happens if a candle is burned until no further burning air is possible, which led him to discover a new gas eventually called nitrogen. This gas does not support combustion or sustain life, showing it was neither combustible like oxygen nor able to support life like carbon dioxide.	Daniel Rutherford	England	carbon-dioxide, combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	Science		
antarctic-circle	1773	Antarctic Circle	The Antarctic Circle was first crossed at sea by Captain James Cook.	James Cook	England	ocean-navigation	Geography		
bacilli	1773	Bacilli	Bacteria could be seen more distinctly than before and categorized by their shapes. Microorganisms were classified into genera and species as per the methods of Linnaeus, particularly identifying rod-shaped bacteria as 'bacilli', spiral-shaped ones as 'spirilla'.	Otto Friedrich Müller	Denmark	microscope, bacteria	Science		
oxygen	1774	Oxygen	Priestley discovered a gas he called 'dephlogisticated air' and eventually oxygen. It allowed combustibles to burn more brilliantly and rapidly than in ordinary air and seemed to have an invigorating effect when inhaled.	Joseph Priestley	England	gas	Science		
chlorine-oxygen	1774	Chlorine oxygen	Scheele isolated the gas chlorine, which was colorless and greenish-yellow in color, named from the Greek word for 'green'. However, Scheele thought it was a combination of some substance with oxygen and did not recognize it as an element, which prevented him from obtaining the credit for its discovery until about thirty years later.	Carl Wilhelm Scheele	Sweden	oxygen	Science		
mesmerism	1774	Mesmerism	Messmer's waved magnets over his patients while reciting prayers, claiming the ability to cure various diseases. Though his methods were discredited, the mind's effect on the body was intriguing and his experiments became the basis of modern hypnosis.	Franz Anton Mesmer	Germany	pathology	Culture		
digitalis	1775	Digitalis	An English physician discovered the medicinal properties of the foxglove plant for heart conditions. The substance obtained was key in treating edema caused by a failing heart, reigniting interest in plant-based medicines.	William Withering	England	medicinal-plants	Science		
races	1776	Races	A classification of the human species into five races was proposed, lead by descriptive criteria such as skin color and physical features without implying any important differences between these groups.	Johann Friedrich Blumenbach	Germany		Culture		
torsion-balance	1777	Torsion balance	The torsion balance uses a fiber or wire's ability to twist under a force to measure weight, providing a way to more precisely measure weight.	Charles-Augustin de Coulomb	France	mechanics	Science		
molybdenum	1778	Molybdenum	Scheele discovered molybdenum, a new chemical element, using methods he had previously applied to isolate another element, manganese.	Scheele	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science		
hawaiian-islands	1778	Hawaiian Islands	Captain Cook explored the Pacific coast of North America and later claimed the Hawaiian Islands for Britain, naming them the Sandwich Islands. This discovery extended British claims in the Pacific region.	James Cook	England	pacific-ocean	Geography		
fertilization	1779	Fertilization	It was discovered that fertilization in humans involved male sperms physically contacting the eggs within the female ovaries, contrary to the prior belief that males provided the 'seed' and females were simply the soil. This newfound understanding clarified that reproduction was a joint process involving contributions from both the mother and father.	Lazzaro Spallanzani	Italy	no-spontaneous-generation	Science		
photosynthesis	1779	Photosynthesis	The process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose, using sunlight as the energy source, was further elucidated. This essential plant function that produces not only oxygen but also complex organic molecules.	Jan Ingenhousz	Netherlands	plants-and-carbon-dioxide	Science		
electrical-stimulation	1780	Electrical stimulation	This invention demonstrated that the muscles of dissected frog legs twitched when struck by a spark from a Leyden jar, suggesting that muscles were activated by electrical impulses. This foundational experiment led to significant insights into bioelectric phenomena in living tissues and laid the foundation for electrophysiology.	Luigi Galvani	Italy	lightning-rod	Science		
uranus	1781	Uranus	The discovery of Uranus expanded our knowledge of the solar system by revealing a seventh planet. This celestial body was initially mistaken for a comet but was identified due to its distinct circular and sharp-edged appearance.	William Herschel	England	telescope	Space		
binary-stars	1781	Binary stars	Two stars sometimes orbit each other due to gravitational forces. The discovery contradicted the earlier belief that close pairs of stars were merely coincidentally aligned, showing that they could in fact be gravitationally bound and move in relation to each other.	William Herschel	England	universal-gravitation	Space		
crystallography	1781	Crystallography	Modern crystallography were established through the discovery that crystal shapes are built from unit cells that stack in a regular pattern spontaneously. 	René-Just Haüy	France	microscope	Science		
mars-axial-tilt	1781	Axial inclination of mars	The axial inclination of Mars was identified, illustrating that like Earth, Mars has a tilted axis which causes seasonal variations similar to those on Earth. The discovery contributed to the understanding of planetary motions and their effects on climate.	William Herschel	England	planet-rotations	Space		
improved-steam-engine	1781	Improved steam engine	Watt's enhancements increased efficiency and power output by recycling steam, maintaining constant cylinder pressure, and enabling use of the engine for driving machinery, which was a pivotal development in the industrial revolution.	James Watt	England	steam-engine	General

rosetta-stone	1799	Rosetta Stone	The Rosetta Stone is an artifact discovered in 1799 bearing an inscription in three forms of writing: Greek, Demotic, and Hieroglyphic, which allowed scholars to begin deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Its discovery provided the key to understanding large portions of Egyptian history that were previously obscure.	Napoleon	French	writing	Culture		
electric-battery	1800	Electric battery	Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery, theorizing that electricity originated in metals and not in biological tissue. His invention led to the creation of a continuous electric current, advancing beyond the non-flowing electric charge of static electricity.	Alessandro Giuseppe Volta	Italy	static-electricity	Science	In 1800, Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist, developed the electric battery based on his hypothesis that electricity was a property of metals rather than originating from muscle tissue, as previously thought by Luigi Galvani. Volta's battery harnessed chemical reactions to produce a steady and continuous flow of electricity, which was a significant advance over static electricity and had tremendous implications for the future use and distribution of electrical power. The first batteries used bowls of salt solution to facilitate the chemical reaction needed for the generation of electricity.	
decomposition-of-water	1800	Decomposition of water	This process involved using an electric current to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, revealing the elemental composition of water. It was a foundational experiment demonstrating the use of electricity to drive a chemical reaction.	William Nicholson	England	electric-battery	Science	Following the invention of the Volta's pile, William Nicholson used the battery to pass an electric current through slightly acidified water. The process of electrolysis resulted in the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, confirming that water was composed of these two elements.	
infrared-radiation	1800	Infrared radiation	This discovery identified invisible infrared radiation as a form of light that causes heating effects, extending the known electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. The work was significant for understanding the nature of electromagnetic waves and led to the development of technologies utilizing infrared.	William Herschel	England	binary-stars	Science	Building on previous work in the study of the light spectrum in 1781, an experiment conducted in 1800 showed that upon placing a thermometer just beyond the red end of the visible light spectrum, an increase in temperature was detected despite the absence of visible light. This revealed the presence of a form of light invisible to the human eye, which we now know as infrared radiation.	
gas-lighting	1800	Gas lighting	Gas powered light involved the burning of coal to produce flammable gases, which could be transported and used for illumination. It revolutionized lighting, allowing for the first widespread street and indoor lighting.	William Murdoch	England	candle	Design	The invention of gas lighting by William Murdoch marked the transition from traditional oil and wax based lighting to a system where coal-derived gases could be piped and burned to create light. Murdoch's innovation eventually led to the widespread use of gas lighting in streets and homes, vastly improving illumination and extending productive hours after sundown.	
nitrous-oxide	1800	Nitrous oxide	Nitrous oxide is a gas that induces a state of exhilaration and anesthesia when inhaled, with effects including laughter and pain suppression. It was initially a novelty but found practical use in dentistry as an anesthetic.	Humphry Davy	England	dentistry,oxygen	Science	A British chemist, Humphry Davy, discovered nitrous oxide in 1800. Through his experimental work with the gas, Davy identified its anesthetic properties, reporting a reduction in pain sensation when inhaled. Eventually, it became widely used in dentistry for its anesthetic qualities and was also popularized as a short-lived social fad for its euphoriant effects.	
tissues	1800	Tissues	Careful observations (without a microscope) showed Bichat that the various organs were built up out of a mixture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usually flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues.	Marie François Xavier Bichat	France	cadaver	Science	The French physician Marie François Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) was notable for the many postmortems he conducted in his very short profes- sional life. His careful ob- servations (without a microscope) showed him that the various organs were built up out of a mix- ture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usu- ally flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues. In 1800 he published a book called Treatise on Membranes in which he listed and carefully de- scribed twenty-one differ- ent types of tissues. He is for this reason considered the founder of the science of histology (the study of tis-sues).	
malleable-platinum	1801	Malleable platinum	Wollaston devised a method for making platnium malleable despite its inertness and high melting point. He kept the method secret. Working with platnium he also discovered two other metals very similar in properties to it. These were palladium and rhodium.	William Hyde Wollaston	England	platinum	Science	Platinum, because of its in- ertness and its high melting point, would be marvelously suited to laboratory equipment fi only it could be easily worked and pounded into shape. A method for doing so was worked out by a British chemist, William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828), iHe kept his method secret and never allowed anyone in his laboratory. In this way he earned a fortune. He arranged to have his method published after his death. In working with plati-num, he discovered two other metals very similar in properties to it. These were palladium and rhodium.	
jacquard-loom	1801	Jacquard loom	The Jacquard Loom revolutionized the weaving process by allowing intricate patterns to be woven automatically. It used punched cards to control the loom's needles, enabling it to create complex textile designs with less manual labor.	Joseph-Marie Jacquard	France	flying-shuttle	Design	The Jacquard Loom was an innovation that allowed textiles to be woven with complex patterns without requiring the intensive manual labor that was traditionally necessary. This machine used a series of punched cards, which corresponded to a particular pattern. When these cards were used in the loom, needles would pass through the holes to form the desired pattern in the textile. This automation of pattern weaving not only increased production efficiency but also allowed for the creation of much more intricate designs than were previously feasible by hand weaving.	
discovery-of-ceres	1801	Discovery of Ceres	Ceres was discovered by an Italian astronomer when he serendipitously spotted the object while working at an observatory, and it was notable for being the first known dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This discovery adhered to the predictions made by Bode's law regarding planetary distances.	Giuseppe Piazzi	Italy	jupiter-moons, mars-distance	Space	Ceres was discovered on January 1, 1801, fitting within the framework of Bode's law, which suggested the placement of a planet between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres, though smaller than Mars and more slowly moving, however, turned out to be a dwarf planet and not a full-sized planet as Johann Elert Bode's law had predicted, marking an important contribution to astronomical understanding at the time.	
invertebrates	1801	Invertebrates	Up to now, less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for 'worms"). Lamarck divided the invertebrates into groups like the crustaceans, echinoderms, and distinguished between the eight-legged arachnids and the six-legged insects.	Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck	France	taxonomy	Science	Linnaeus (see 1735) and others in the past three- quarters of a century had elaborated the taxonomy of vertebrates (those animals with backbones-mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fish) in considerable detail. The less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for " 'worms"). The French naturalist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) tackled the problem in publications beginning in 1801. He divided the invertebrates into groups and created such di- visions as the crustaceans(crabs and lobsters) and echinoderms (starfish andsea urchins). He distin-guishedbetween the eight- legged arachnids (spiders and scorpions) and the six-legged insects. In fact, La- marck was the first to usethe terms vertebrate and in-vertebrate, and he popular- ized the term biolog y for the study of life	
ultraviolet	1801	Ultraviolet	This discovery revealed that the spectrum of light extends beyond the visible violet end, where darkening paper soaked in silver nitrate suggested a new type of radiation termed 'ultraviolet' because it is beyond the visible spectrum. The discovery showcased the existence of light that is not visible to the naked eye but has measurable effects.	Johann Wilhelm Ritter	Germany	infrared-radiation	Science	In 1800, an individual working on the study of the spectrum of light realized that soaked paper in silver nitrate darkened rapidly when exposed to the spectrum's end beyond the visible violet spectrum. The effect was less pronounced at the red end of the spectrum, leading to the conclusion that there is radiation beyond the visible spectrum termed 'ultraviolet', indicating its position beyond the violet light. n founding the modrn science of invertebrate zoology, Lamarck began the process of understanding the importance of inverte- brate life. All the verte- brates are included in but a single phylum, while there are about twenty-two phyla of invertebrates. The number of species of insects alone far exceeds the number of species of vertebrates; indeed, it exceeds the number of species of all other animals combined.	
light-waves	1801	Light waves	Young's famous double slit interference experiments with light confirmed its wave-like behavior, demonstrating that light can exhibit patterns of interference similar to waves in water or sound, which supported the wave theory of light.	Thomas Young	England	light-diffraction, light-as-wave	Science	In 1801, an English physicist started a series of experiments that showed light could exhibit wave-like properties through interference patterns. By allowing two beams of light to overlap and interfere with each other, it was proven that light consists of waves of different lengths, which reinforced the argument that light is a wave and not just a particle, challenging previously held notions about the fundamental nature of light.	
discovery-of-niobium	1801	Discovery of niobium	An English chemist discovered a new element within a mineral from the British Museum, initially calling it Columbium (after Columbia, a name for the US), but it later became officially known as niobium. The element's establishment was contentious due to national pride and scientific debate.	Charles Hatchett	England	chemical-elements	Science	Charles Hatchett analyzed a mineral from the British Museum, which was sent there from Connecticut, and identified a new element in 1801. There was a dispute over whether the substance was a new element, but it was finally accepted and officially named niobium, with Hatchett initially calling it columbium in honor of the 'Columbia' (a historical name for the United States). Despite the initial naming, the United States lost the honor of having the element named after it.	
asteroids	1802	Asteroids	This discovery refers to the identification of new celestial bodies between Mars and Jupiter, which were distinct from planets due to their smaller size. They were initially named after Greek deities and later became known as the asteroid belt.	Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers	Germany	discovery-of-ceres	Space	In 1802, following the discovery of Ceres in 1801, German scientists led by Olbers found another celestial body between Mars and Jupiter, naming it Pallas. Further discoveries led to the identification of additional bodies, such as Athena in 1804, and Vesta and Juno in 1807. These bodies were smaller than planets and were eventually realized to be part of a larger collection that would be called asteroids, forming the asteroid belt.	
tantalum	1802	Tantalum	The invention is the discovery of a new metal, which was named after the Greek mythological figure Tantalus. It is a rare, hard, blue-gray metal known for its resistance to corrosion paralleling Tantalus's own unattainable desires.	Anders Gustav Ekeberg	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	Anders Gustav Ekeberg, a Swedish chemist, analyzed minerals from Finland and discovered a new metal in 1802, which he named tantalum. The name was inspired by the Greek mythological figure Tantalus, reflecting the metal's resistance to absorption and corrosion, paralleling Tantalus's own unattainable desires.	
atomic-theory	1803	Atomic theory	The Atomic Theory posits that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms, which combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds. It laid the groundwork for modern chemistry and provided a systematic explanation for chemical reactions based on the combination and rearrangement of atoms.	John Dalton	England	boyles-law	Science	In 1803, an English chemist put forth a comprehensive summary of atomic theory, which suggested that all matter is made up of atoms. This was a more defined, evidence-based approach that built upon Boyle's law and personal investigations. The chemist proposed the idea, for instance, that 8 grams of oxygen would combine with 1 gram of hydrogen to form 9 grams of water, implying that the compound would have a correlating weight. Dalton even utilized the term 'atom' from Democritus but provided a new theory based on experiments and careful chemical observation rather than speculation.	
meteorites	1803	Meteorites	Biot investigated hundreds of supposed meteorite sightings and concluded that the reports were correct and that meteorites did exist and did fall from the sky.	Jean-Baptiste Biot	France	meteorites-hypothesis	Space	Scientist Chladni's work in the late 18th century prompted the scientific community to seriously consider the possibility of meteorites. Following this, Jean-Baptiste Biot confirmed reports of stone falls by examining falls in a region 100 miles west of Paris, arguably laying the foundation for modern planetary science.	
cerium-osmium-iridium	1803	Cerium, Osmium, Iridium	Three new elements were discovered, expanding the periodic table and contributing to the understanding of Earth's composition and the diversity of naturally occurring elements.	Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	New chemical elements, specifically cerium, osmium, and iridium, were discovered in 1803 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius and his colleagues. The discovery of these elements not only broadened the scope of known elements during that period but also provided new substances for study and use in various chemical applications.	
scientific-ballooning	1804	Scientific ballooning	A balloon carrying Biote and Gay-Lussac ascent reached an alpine peak in the Alps (4 miles elevation) to test the composition of the air and to study Earth's magnetic field. This kicked off significant use of balloons for conducting scientific research and marked the beginning of high-altitude explorations.	Jean-Baptiste Biot and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac	France	hot-air-balloon, scientific-voyages	Science	Scientific ballooning began in 1804 when Biote and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac made a balloon ascent reaching a height of 4 miles, reaching an alpine peak in the Alps. This endeavor enabled them to test the composition of the air and to study Earth's magnetic field, contrasting their findings with measurements at sea level, which showed no change, laying the groundwork for future atmospheric explorations.	
steam-locomotive	1804	Steam locomotive	The concept of a steam locomotive was based on the idea that if steam can turn paddle wheels in water, it should be able to turn wheels on land. Early designs faced challenges such as losing too much energy until Trevithick invented iron rails on which the wheels rode. Still he did not reach commercial success.	Richard Trevithick	England	improved-steam-engine	General	The concept of a steam locomotive was based on the idea that if steam can turn paddle wheels in water, it should be able to turn wheels on land. The early steam-powered vehicle faced challenges such as losing too much energy but paved the way for the subsequent development of more efficient steam locomotive designs.	
missouri-river	1804	Missouri River	The Lewis and Clark Expedition explored the Missouri river to its source, onward to the Oregon Territory, then to the Columbia River into the Pacific ocean, the first ocean-to-ocean and back trip across the United States.	Meriwether Lewis and William Clark	United States	america	Geography		
morphine	1805	Morphine	An alcoholic extract of immature opium blooms was called laudanum and had first been introduced by Paracelsus. The chemical eventually named morphene and found much more effective in dulling pain and inducing sleep than the juice itself.	Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Ferdinand Serturner	Germany	mineralogy	Science	Morphine, extracted from opium poppies, was developed as a medication to alleviate severe pain without causing the patient to lose consciousness. It represented a major advancement in pain management and remains one of the most potent analgesics used in medicine today, although it also has the potential for addiction and abuse.	
asparagine	1806	Asparagine	Asparagine was the first amino acid to be isolated, marking a significant milestone in the field of organic chemistry and biochemistry. This discovery laid the groundwork for understanding the role of amino acids in biological systems.	Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin	Germany		Science	In 1806, a substance called asparagine was isolated from asparagus, which was eventually realized to be the first of a set of compounds extremely important to life, known as amino acids. The isolation of asparagine pointed to a broader understanding of the biological importance of amino acids.	
sodium-and-potassium	1807	Sodium and potassium	New elemental metals, sodium and potassium, were isolated using electrolysis, a process that uses an electric current to decompose substances. This breakthrough enabled the isolation of several alkali metals, which had a significant impact on the development of the field of electrochemistry.	Humphry Davy	England	decomposition-of-water	Science	The isolation of sodium and potassium was achieved by passing an electric current through molten potassium carbonate and then through a solution of sodium carbonate. The electrolysis process resulted in the liberation of the metals which were previously unable to be isolated by conventional chemical means. This experiment led to the isolation of the alkali metals barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium in the subsequent year and excited the scientific world, propelling the study of electrochemistry.	
working-steamboat	1807	Practical Steamboat	The completion of the steamboat Clermont marked a significant development in navigable technology, making the steamboat a commercial success. It traveled from New York to Albany in record time, at an avearge speed of 5 mph.	Robert Fulton	United States	steamboat	Design	Robert Fulton is credited with making the steamboat a commercial success, culminating in 1807 with the creation of the Clermont. This steamboat was 133 feet long and could maintain an average speed of nearly 5 miles per hour. With the introduction of the Clermont, the use of steamboats proliferated, enhancing trade and passenger transport on rivers and coastal waters, and setting the stage for the expansion of the steamboat fleet.	
polarized-light	1808	Polarized light	By playing with a crystal of Iceland spar, visible light could be polarized, thus finding that light could exhibit properties similar to that of a magnet with different poles. 	Étienne-Louis Malus	France	double-refraction	Science	The discovery was made when the physicist observed that when sunlight passed through a crystal of Iceland spar, instead of showing double refraction as expected, it produced a single ray of light after passing through the crystal at a certain angle. When the crystal was aligned at right angles to its original direction, a new ray of light appeared while the first ray disappeared; a phenomenon the physicist named polarized light, although his initial assumption about light having poles like magnets turned out to be incorrect.	
mechanism-of-evolution	1809	Mechanism of evolution	Lamarck theorized that the use or disuse of certain body parts by animals could lead to the development of these parts and potentially be inherited by offspring, contributing to evolutionary changes.	Jean-Baptiste Lamarck	France	invertebrates	Science	The theory posited that biological evolution had taken place and could be influenced by organisms' interaction with their environment. For instance, the theory suggested that giraffes developed longer necks to reach leaves, and these traits could be passed on to their offspring. This idea stems from the concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was later shown not to be a mechanism of inheritance. Nonetheless, the publication stirred interest in the field of evolution.	
aerodynamics	1809	Aerodynamics	Cayley visualized flying devices with fixed wings; tails with control surfaces to allow turning and braking, and propulsive mechanisms. 	George Cayley	England	mechanics	Science	The dream of human flight led to the establishment of foundational principles in aerodynamics, with early conceptualizations of flying devices that used fixed wings and appropriate surfaces to interact with air currents for lift, control, and movement. The publications from 1809 by a British scientist began to lay down the theoretical groundwork for these ideas, which would greatly influence the future of flight technology.	
phrenology	1810	Phrenology	Gall proposed that the brain's shape played a major role in its function, and that its shape could be determined by the irregularities and bumps externally visible on the skull. This pseudoscientific discipline was later discredited.	Franz Joseph Gall	Germany	races, brain-areas	Culture	In 1810, German physician Franz Joseph Gall published the first volume of a four-volume treatise on the nervous system, which outlined the foundations of phrenology. Gall believed that mental capacities and different parts of the brain involved with different parts of the human body could be correlated with the shape of the brain. According to this theory, certain brain areas corresponding to certain traits resulted in bulges or indentations on the skull, allowing one to analyze a person’s psychological attributes by examining these bumps on the head.	
chlorine	1810	Chlorine	Up to now, chlorine was considered to be an oxygen-containing compound. Davy showed this was not so, and that chlorine was a distinct element. 	Humphry Davy	England	oxygen, chlorine-oxygen	Science	Chlorine was identified as an element by Davy, refuting prior beliefs that it was a compound containing oxygen as suggested by Scheele. Davy's work on hydrochloric acid showed that chlorine, present within the acid, did not contain oxygen, contrary to the common thought of the time which associated acid properties to the presence of oxygen.	
avogadro-hypothesis	1811	Avogadro's hypothesis	This hypothesis states that all gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles, thereby explaining the relationship between the volume and number of particles of a gas. 	Amedeo Avogadro	Italy	atomic-theory	Science	Avogadro's hypothesis posited that at equal temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain an equal number of particles, regardless of the type of gas. This principle was foundational for developing a deeper understanding of molecular composition and stoichiometry in chemistry. Avogadro suggested that substances like water vapor were composed of molecules, specifically, in water's case, of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and not as single atoms as John Dalton had previously suggested. This idea facilitated the conceptual separation of atoms and molecules and led to essential developments in the molecular theory of gases and compounds.	
iodine	1811	Iodine	Iodine was discovered by a French chemist when he was manufacturing potassium nitrate for gunpowder and accidentally added too much acid to potassium carbonate. This resulted in a beautiful violet vapor that condensed into dark, lustrous crystals. It was suspected to be a new element, confirmed by chemists, and named from the Greek word for 'violet'.	Bernard Courtois	France	gunpowder	Science	While manufacturing potassium nitrate needed in gunpowder, Bernard Courtois added too much acid to potassium carbonate and upon heating, obtained a violet vapor that condensed into dark crystals. After his discovery, he suspected it might be a new element and passed it on for confirmation. It was eventually confirmed and the name 'iodine' was suggested, originating from the Greek word for violet.	
catalysis	1812	Catalysis	Starch was first converted into a sugar (corn syrup), by heating it with sulfuric acid in acid-catalyzed reaction. Since the sulfuric acid was not consumed, it was the first documented example of catalysis in organic chemistry, even though the general concept of catalysis was known (e.g. yeast). 	Gottlieb Sigismund Constantin Kirchhoff	Russia	fermentation	Science	Humans have known since ancient times that substances like yeast can cause reactions indefinitely without being consumed themselves. This concept was further explored by Gottlieb Sigismund Constantin Kirchhoff, who pondered the idea of non-living substances that could catalyze changes, leading to a deeper understanding of chemical reactions.	
catastrophism	1812	Catastrophism	Cuvier's concept of catastrophism was based on the observation that fossils seemed to represent extinct creatures and that the deeper the strata, the less the fossils resembled modern organisms, implying a succession of catastrophic events. Cuvier is considered the founder of paleontology.	Georges Cuvier	France	uniformitarianism	Science	Georges Cuvier's work on catastrophism involved the study of fossils to advance the idea that Earth's natural history was influenced by a series of catastrophic events that led to the mass extinctions of certain life forms, with new forms arising post these events. This challenged the previously dominant view of uniformitarianism and underlined the belief in successive creations in Earth's history.	
universe-as-machine	1812	Universe as machine	Laplace suggested a deterministic universe, proposing that if one knew the position and velocity of every particle, the future and past of the universe could be calculated, eliminating the need for divine intervention. This idea formalized the concept of a universe obeying mechanical laws without exception.	Pierre-Simon Laplace	France	laws-motion	Science	Pierre-Simon Laplace's theory posited that the universe operates like a vast automatic machine following a predetermined path. According to his hypothesis, by knowing the position and velocity of all particles, one could predict future events which led to the philosophical viewpoint that a mechanistic universe operates without the need for a Godly figure to guide or intervene in natural processes.	
chemical-symbols	1813	Chemical symbols	A system for representing atoms using simple letters was adopted, with single letters or letter pairs denoting elements like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and more complex symbols for compounds. The system simplified the communication and instruction of chemical compositions and continues to be standard in chemistry.	Jöns Jakob Berzelius	Sweden	atomic-theory	Science	With the advancement of atomic theory, there arose the need for a simple method to represent atoms. In 1813, this led to the use of letters, such as H for a hydrogen atom and O for an oxygen atom, among others, as a standardized system for representing chemical elements and compounds, which simplified scientific communication and is still in use today.	
plant-classification	1813	Plant classification	This new plant classification system was a significant part of a large encyclopedia project that improved the system of plant classification beyond that of Linnaeus, providing a more detailed basis for the scientific understanding and categorization of plants.	Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle	France	taxonomy, plant-species-classified	Science	In 1813, French botanist Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle began an ambitious project to catalog plant life, devising an improved system of classification. While only seven of the projected twenty volumes were published before his death, his work built upon and refined Linnaean taxonomy, offering a more detailed plant classification system still in use today.	
spectral-lines	1814	Spectral lines	Meticulously crafted prisms could be used to observe dark lines in the solar spectrum, leading to the identification of nearly six hundred lines. These lines, known as Fraunhofer lines, marked the wavelengths where light was absorbed and became foundational in the fields of chemistry and astronomy for identifying elemental composition.	Joseph von Fraunhofer	Germany	light-spectrum	Science	Since Isaac Newton's initial study of the spectrum in 1666, the understanding of light had not significantly advanced until 1814 when a German physicist crafted precise prisms and observed the solar spectrum through a narrow slit. By observing and mapping the positions of these dark lines, known as Fraunhofer lines, he laid the groundwork for spectroscopy, which would become an essential tool for chemists and astronomers to determine the composition of different materials and celestial bodies.	
plane-of-polarized-light	1815	Plane of polarized light	An experiment showed that two pieces of Iceland spar, if lined up parallel, allow unpolarized light to pass through unimpeded, while if one piece is rotated, the plane of the polarized light must be turned for the light to pass through again. 	Jean-Baptiste Biot	France	polarized-light	Science	In 1815, it was discovered that polarized light could behave differently when it passed through organic substances. Specifically, when Iceland spar (calcite) was used to polarize light, and then the polarized light was passed through an organic liquid, the plane of polarization had to be rotated to allow the light to continue through another piece of Iceland spar. This effect was noted since certain organic liquids caused the light to twist, suggesting an asymmetry in the molecules of organic substances. Important connections were made regarding the interaction between light and the structure of organic molecules.	
organic-radicals	1815	Organic radicals	Through work with poisonous gas hydrogen cyanide, he discovered another gas cyanogen (CN_2), and went to show that carbon-nitrogen or cyano group is very stable and maintained integrity through various chemical changes. A significant contribution to organic chemistry.	Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac	France	chemical-elements	Science	In 1815, a scientific breakthrough occurred with the understanding of organic radicals, which are groups of atoms that remain consistent through different chemical reactions. The discovery that was highlighted is the identification of cyanogen, a carbon-nitrogen compound, which maintained its structural integrity as it transferred as a unit through various chemical reactions. This concept was instrumental in progressing the understanding of organic chemistry and the behavior of organic compounds during chemical changes.	
prouts-hypothesis	1815	Prout's hypothesis	Prout's Hypothesis suggested that all atomic weights are whole number multiples of hydrogen, proposing that hydrogen constitutes the fundamental atom and that other elements are composed of hydrogen atoms. This was a significant step in atomic theory, though it was later proven to be an oversimplification.	William Prout 	England	atomic-theory	Science	An English chemist in 1815 put forward a hypothesis that posited hydrogen as the primary building block of all other elements, suggesting that the atomic weights of elements are integral multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. While this theory greatly influenced the atomic theory, it was eventually refined as inaccuracies were discovered. The concept, however, helped pave the way for our current understanding of atomic structure and elemental composition.	
macadamized-roads	1815	Macadamized roads	Macadamized roads (named after the inventor) improved on older road construction methods and involved laying stones of specific sizes in layers and then compacting them for durability and raising them for proper drainage. They became prominent in Great Britain before spreading to other countries.	John Loudon McAdam	England	paved-road	Design	Paved roads, or 'Macadamized Roads', were invented in 1815 by John Loudon McAdam, who discovered a more efficient road-building method involving laying stones in layers with larger sizes at the base and smaller ones on the surface, followed by compaction with fine gravel or slag. This technique improved upon previous road-building methods by creating a road surface that was elevated above adjacent fields for better water runoff and that was significantly more durable and effective for transportation.	
stethoscope	1816	Stethoscope	The stethoscope is a medical device used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs, and other organs in the human body. It was a significant advancement in diagnostic procedures which previously relied on placing the ear directly to the patient for auscultation.	René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laënnec	France	microscope	Science	Diagnostic procedures were limited in the early days of modern medicine, but one obvious way of getting information was to place the ear to the chest wall and listen to the sound of the heartbeat. In 1816, a French physician, faced with the necessity of listening to the heartbeat of a young woman, invented the stethoscope as a means to maintain decorum and improve the audibility of internal sounds. He used a rolled-up piece of paper to create a tube that amplified these sounds, which he found to be louder compared to directly placing his ear against the patient's chest.	
chlorophyll	1817	Chlorophyll	The discovery of chlorophyll marked a significant advancement in plant chemistry, identifying the substance responsible for the green pigmentation in plants that also plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by trapping sunlight and converting it into energy, which in turn creates plant tissue and oxygen.	Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou	France	photosynthesis	Science	Building on prior research into how plants restore the vitality of air, two scientists in 1817 isolated a green compound from plants that was critical for photosynthesis. This compound, later named chlorophyll, is essential for plants to capture light energy and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, a process fundamental to plant life and the broader ecosystem.	
cadmium-lithium-selenium	1817	Cadmium, Lithium, Selenium	New chemical elements cadmium, lithium, and selenium were isolated, expanding the knowledge of the periodic table and contributing to various scientific and industrial applications.	Friedrich Strohmeyer, Johan August Arfwedson, and Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Germany and Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	Friedrich Strohmeyer discovered cadmium in zinc carbonate while analyzing an impurity that appeared during strong heating, naming it after the Latin word for calamine. Johan August Arfwedson identified lithium in mineral petalite, named after the Greek word for stone, and Jöns Jacob Berzelius discovered selenium in sulfuric acid chamber muds, naming it after the Greek word for moon.	
transverse-light-waves	1818	Transverse light waves	Fresnel suggested that light was a transverse wave, suggesting that it would explain reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Furthermore, a transverse wave would explain polarization.	Augustin-Jean Fresnel	France	light-waves,plane-of-polarized-light	Science	In 1818, a French physicist published a treatise that considered transverse light waves in a detailed mathematical way, showing that such waves would account for reflection, refraction, and diffraction just as well as longitudinal waves. The discovery explained polarized light, which couldn't be elucidated by the previously accepted model of light purely consisting of longitudinal waves.	
enckes-comet	1818	Encke's comet	Encke's Comet was the second comet after Halley's whose cometary orbit had been worked out. This one was the first short-period comet, with a period of 3.3 years, which challenged previous celestial calculations.	Johann Franz Encke	Germany	halley-comet	Space	German astronomer Johann Franz Encke calculated the orbit of a comet that was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons and concluded that it had a short period of return. The comet, now known as Encke's Comet, had its orbit calculated precisely, something no previous comet had achieved.	
atomic-weights	1818	Atomic weights	After thousands of analyses on chemicals, Berzelius published a table of atomic weights. This marked a milestone in the field of chemistry, providing a systematic foundation for the identification and classification of elements.	Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Sweden	chemical-nomenclature	Science	In 1818, a chemist felt justified in publishing a table of atomic weights based on thousands of analyses on various chemicals after years of meticulous work. This table helped standardize chemical weights and contributed to the progress of chemical science by providing a more consistent way to classify and identify elements.	
specific-heat	1819	Specific heat	Each substance requires a certain amount of heat to raise its temperature by 1 degree C. This discovery showed that the specific heat of an element was inversely proportional to its atomic weight.	Pierre-Louis Dulong and Alexis-Thérèse Petit	France	atomic-theory	Science		
steamship	1819	Steamship	The steamship combined steam-powered engine technology with traditional sail-based navigation. Although largely reliant on sails, the steam engine on board opened up new possibilities of travel and trade by providing consistent power, particularly important for gentler rivers where wind conditions could be less favorable.	John Fitch and Robert Fulton	United States	working-steamboat, ocean-navigation	General	The steamboats designed by John Fitch and later improved by Robert Fulton were primarily intended for river travel, utilizing steam engine power to propel the vessel. The notable journey of the American steamship Savannah in 1819 demonstrated the potential of this technology by sailing from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool, England, despite the steam engine being active for only a small portion of the voyage.	
electromagnetism	1820	Electromagnetism	Electrical current flowing through wires creates magnetic fields, which can cause a compass needle to deflect and current-carrying wires to attract or repel each other. This discovery established the foundation of electro-magnetism in physics.	Hans Christian Ørsted 	Denmark	compass	Science	In 1820, it was demonstrated that an electric current creates a magnetic field. When currents flowed in opposite directions through wires placed close together, the wires repelled each other, whereas they attracted each other when the currents flowed in the same direction. This interaction was further illustrated by André-Marie Ampère, who showed that current flowing through a wire bent into a helix could strengthen the magnetic effect, with the helix acting like a magnet with a north pole and a south pole.	
simple-electromagnet	1820	Simple electromagnet	Electromagnetism was improved upon by André-Marie Ampère, who showed that current flowing through a wire bent into a helix could strengthen the magnetic effect, with the helix acting like a magnet with a north pole and a south pole.	André-Marie Ampère	France	electromagnetism	Science		
glycine	1820	Glycine	Glycine is a simple amino acid discovered by heating gelatin with acids, which was eventually found to consist of bound substances that could split apart, revealing a hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen combination distinct from sugars. This discovery was significant in the study of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.	Henri Braconnot	France	catalysis	Science	Following Friedrich Accum and others' work on isolating substances from complex compounds, the substance glycine was identified after gelatin, derived from animals, was heated with acids. It was named glycine from the Greek word for sweet, and it was eventually recognized as an amino acid, not a sugar, due to its chemical composition featuring hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms, unlike sugars which do not contain nitrogen atoms.	
antarctic-land	1820	Antarctic land	This discovery marked the first known sighting of the Antarctic peninsula, a significant landmass north of the Antarctic Circle, by a British naval commander and a Russian explorer in the same geographical region. It contributed to early 19th-century exploration efforts and laid the groundwork for future Antarctic expeditions.	Palmer, Bransfield, Bellingshausen	America, England, Russia	antarctic-circle	Geography	In the year 1820, both a British naval commander named Edward Bransfield and a Russian explorer named Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen claimed to have sighted land in the Antarctic region. While there was no way to know the exact nature of the landscape, it was later realized that they had encountered the Antarctic peninsula. This discovery played a key role in the history of Antarctic exploration and helped to expand geographic knowledge of the previously uncharted region.	
diffraction-gratings	1821	Diffraction gratings	Diffraction gratings are optical components used to disperse light into individual colors or wavelengths, which have largely replaced prisms in the study of light spectra. They are essential in the field of spectroscopy for resolving fine details in the spectrum of emitted or reflected light.	Joseph von Fraunhofer	Germany	light-spectrum	Science	Following experiments with light, diffraction gratings were developed as a means to produce more detailed and precise light spectra than what could be achieved with prisms alone. They consisted of fine, parallel lines scratched on glass, which when illuminated by light, produced detailed spectra by diffracting the light at different angles depending on the wavelength.	
electrical-motion	1821	Electrical motion	This discovery laid the foundation for the relationship between electricity and motion, showing how electric currents can produce mechanical movement. The finding was pivotal in developing electromagnetic technology and influenced many future innovations, including electric motors.	Michael Faraday	England	electromagnetism	Science	The discovery of electromagnetism continued to trigger a surge of experimentation, particularly with Michael Faraday's setup of an electrical circuit that included two wires and two magnets. The experimentation showed that when an electric current passed through a wire, it could cause motion in a nearby magnet or wire, thus demonstrating for the first time that electricity can produce mechanical motion in controlled circumstances.	
seebeck-effect	1821	Seebeck effect	The Seebeck effect is the first demonstration of thermoelectricity, generating a voltage difference in a circuit composed of two different metals that are connected at two places with different temperatures. This effect found applications in power generation and temperature measurement	Thomas Johann Seebeck	Germany	electromagnetism	Science	German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered in 1821 that when two different metals were joined at two places and kept at different temperatures, an electric current would be generated. This finding is crucial for understanding thermoelectric effects and is the basis for technologies such as thermocouples and thermoelectric generators.	
glaciers	1821	Glaciers	Venetz suggested that Glaciers must, at some time in the past, have extended far beyond their present limits, explaining why striation patterns resembling glacier movement were found so far from present glaciation.	Ignatz Venetz	Switzerland	popular-mountain-climbing	Geography	The section on Glaciers discusses how these massive ice forms were observed to move like rivers of ice down mountainsides, with geologists also noting striations in rocks caused by their movement. A Swiss geologist published material in 1821 proposing that glaciers once extended much further than they do in modern times; however, the idea did not gain immediate traction.	
fourier-analysis	1822	Fourier analysis	Fourier's theorem outlined the flow of heat and introduced the concept of using sinusoidal components to break down any periodic function, which became the foundation for the field of Fourier analysis. This work significantly advanced the understanding of heat transfer and laid the groundwork for modern signal processing.	Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier	France	calculus	Math	The 1822 publication by French mathematician Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier presented his 'Analytical Theory of Heat', which explained how heat flows using sinusoidal series to express any periodic function. Fourier's work established the technique of dimensional analysis and indicated that the basic set of units should be mass, length, and time, from which other units are derived.	
analytical-engine	1822	Analytical engine	The Analytical Engine was an early mechanical general-purpose computer. It was designed to perform any kind of calculation or logical operation automatically by using punched cards.	Charles Babbage	England	jacquard-loom	Science	Around 1822, Charles Babbage began developing the concept for a machine capable of performing a wide range of calculations by mechanical means, including the use of punched cards. Although a full operational version was never completed in his lifetime, the design of the Analytical Engine laid the groundwork for future computers, being able to perform sequential operations and print results.	
projective-geometry	1822	Projective geometry	Projective geometry is a foundational part of modern geometry dealing with properties and principles that are invariant under projection transformations. Roughly it is the study of the shadows cast by geometric figures.	Jean-Victor Poncelet	France	analytic-geometry	Math	While he was a prisoner of war during Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, Jean-Victor Poncelet reflected on the properties of geometric figures under projection, leading to publications that established the discipline of projective geometry, which studies the relationships between shapes as they appear in perspective or when projected onto various surfaces.	
iguanodon	1822	Iguanodon	The Iguanodon was a significant discovery in paleontology, being a large ancient reptile whose name reflects its iguana-like teeth. As it turned out, this was the first of what would eventually be called dinosaurs.	Gideon Mantell	England		Science	In 1822, Gideon Mantell made a groundbreaking discovery when he identified the bones and teeth resembling those of an iguana, but much larger, which turned out to be from a previously unknown large ancient reptile later named 'Iguanodon'. It was one of the earliest recognitions of what would become classified as dinosaurs.	
hieroglyphics	1822	Hieroglyphics	The decipherment of hieroglyphics by Jean-François Champollion marked a breakthrough in Egyptology, allowing for the interpretation of ancient Egyptian script.	Jean-François Champollion	France	rosetta-stone	Culture	Jean-François Champollion made a monumental stride in 1822 by deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphs, realizing some symbols were alphabetic, some syllabic, and others represented a whole word or idea. This discovery established the field of Egyptology, enabling the interpretation of texts from ancient Egyptian civilization.	
gastric-acidity	1823	Gastric acidity	Prout discovered that stomach hydrochloric acid is part of what permits digestion without harming the stomach lining. This challenged the vitalist theory by showing the presence of such a strong acid within living organisms.	William Prout	England	digestion, acids	Science	In 1823, it was discovered that human stomach secretions contained hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid involved in the digestive process. This acid is part of living beings and aids in digestion without damaging the stomach lining, posing a significant question against the vitalist theory which posited a clear distinction between the chemicals of living organisms and those of nonliving matter.	
platinum-as-catalyst	1823	Platinum as catalyst	Döbereiner discovered that hydrogen gas ignites in the presence of powdered platinum without the platinum being consumed, which laid the groundwork for the idea of metal catalysis in chemical reactions. This led to the innovation of an automatic lighter and has significant implications for industrial chemistry.	Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner	Germany	catalysis, malleable-platinum	Science	As early as 1816, it had been noted that platinum seemed to help ignite and burn hydrogen more readily, but in 1823, the effect of powdered platinum acting as a catalyst was observed. It was found that the platinum wasn't consumed in the process. Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner's observation of this phenomenon led to further developments in catalysis and the invention of an automatic lighter, propelling the use of catalysts in industrial chemical reactions.	
isomers	1823	Isomers	One chemist studying silver isocyanate, and another studying silver fulminate submitted their findings to a scientific journal whose editor realized that both compounds had the same number of atoms but vastly different properties because of their respective arrangement.	Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig	Germany	atomic-theory	Science	Isomerism was identified as a phenomenon where substances with the same molecular formula possess different chemical properties due to varying arrangements of atoms. This discovery has profound implications in the field of organic chemistry and molecular biology, helping to understand complex molecular structures and their functions.

Michael Faraday	England	gas-volume-temperature, liquid-ammonia	Science	By applying cold temperatures and high pressure systematically, gases such as chlorine were successfully liquefied. This process allowed for more detailed studies of gases and facilitated advancements in various industrial and scientific applications, including refrigeration.	
electromagnets	1823	Electromagnets	An electromagnet was created by insulating an iron bar and winding coiled wire around it. When electricity was introduced, it generated a strong magnetic field. His device would lift 9 pounds —twenty times its own weight while the current was running.	William Sturgeon	England	simple-electromagnet	Science	An electromagnet was created by insulating an iron bar and winding coiled wire around it. When electricity was introduced, it generated a strong magnetic field, which spurred further innovations in electrical engineering and paved the way for the development of electric motors and generators.	
portland-cement	1824	Portland cement	Portland Cement was superior to previous materials used for the same purpose because it could better withstand the elements. This new formulation involved burning clay and limestone together, and it quickly became fundamental in construction due to its strength and cost-effectiveness	Joseph Aspdin	England	steel, coke-iron	General	In 1824, Portland Cement was invented by an English stonemason, which was superior to previous materials used for the same purpose because it could better withstand the elements. This new formulation involved burning clay and limestone together, and it quickly became fundamental in construction due to its strength and cost-effectiveness.	
steam-engine-efficiency	1824	Steam engine efficiency	The study of steam engine efficiency led to the understanding that the maximum efficiency of a steam engine is governed by the temperature difference between the steam at its hottest and the cold water at its coldest. This work laid the groundwork for thermodynamics and the principles of heat engines.	Nicolas-Léonard-Sadi Carnot	France	improved-steam-engine	Science	In 1824, a book titled 'On the Motive Power of Fire' elaborated on the principles governing steam engine efficiency, revealing that the vast majority of energy from fuel was wasted as heat. The insights gained from this work by a French physicist were critical in paving the way for future advancements in steam engine technology and the broader field of thermodynamics.	
distance-of-the-sun	1824	Distance of the Sun	The distance of the Sun from Earth was recalculated to be 95,300,000 miles, off by only 2.6%	Johann Franz Encke	Germany	mars-distance	Space	Using the transit of Venus to calculate the Sun's parallax, the distance from Earth to the Sun was revised and provided a more accurate measurement than Cassini's prior estimation. This was a significant improvement in astronomical knowledge and helped refine further calculations in celestial mechanics.	
no-quintic-equation	1824	No quintic equation	It was conclusively determined that quintic equations, which are polynomial equations of the fifth degree, cannot be solved by radicals (general solutions using algebraic methods).	Niels Henrik Abel	Norway	cubic-equations,heptadecagon	Math	After prolonged efforts by mathematicians to solve quintic equations, or polynomial equations of the fifth degree, it became clear that these equations could not be solved by radicals. This discovery was an important milestone in the development of algebra and influenced the study of equations and their solvability.

steam-locomotive-improved	1825	Practical steam locomotive	Steam locomotives revolutionized transportation by enabling trains to pull multiple carriages much farther and faster than before, as exemplified by pulling thirty-eight carriages at speeds of 12 to 16 miles per hour.	George Stephenson	England	steam-locomotive	General	In 1825, continued improvements in steam engine technology allowed for a functional and commercially viable steam locomotive that significantly accelerated land transport. For the first time, railways became a practical means for moving goods and people, with speeds comparable to galloping horses, signaling the dawn of modern rail transportation.	
aluminum	1825	Aluminum	The isolation of aluminum marked the beginning of the use of aluminum as a precious material, until a more cost-effective production method was discovered sixty years later.	Hans Christian Ørsted	Denmark	microscope, atomic-weights	Science	The isolation of aluminum was a notable scientific achievement, considering that aluminum is extremely difficult to extract from its compounds. Being the first to isolate aluminum, this discovery laid the groundwork for subsequent research and led to aluminum becoming one of the most widely used metals once a cheaper method of obtaining it in quantity was devised.	
gastric-digestion	1825	Gastric digestion	The study of gastric digestion through observation of a Canadian patient with a unique wound and inch-wide fistula leading into his stomach provided early insights into the digestive process and sparked interest in the field.	William Beaumont	United States	gastric-acidity	Science	Following a gunshot wound that resulted in a fistula, a patient's stomach became accessible for direct observations. This circumstance allowed for unprecedented observation and study of the digestive process in action, which led to greater understanding of digestion and had a significant impact on medical science.	
modern-candles	1825	Modern candles	The development of the modern candle, which was odorless and provided better illumination, improved upon thousands of years of candle usage.	Michel-Eugène Chevreul	France	candle	Science	The invention of the modern candle by the French chemist Chevreul was a significant advancement in the field of illumination.

doppler-effect	1842	Doppler effect	The Doppler Effect is a scientific discovery that explains the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source, noting the change in pitch of a locomotive's whistle as it approaches and then recedes from the observer, as a primary example.	Christian Johann Doppler	Austria	steam-locomotive-improved	Science	The discovery of the Doppler Effect was crucial in understanding how the perceived frequency of a wave, such as sound or light, changes when the source of the wave and the observer move relative to each other. An Austrian physicist named Christian Johann Doppler described this principle, noting the change in pitch of a locomotive's whistle as it approaches and then recedes from the observer, as a primary example. The Doppler Effect helps explain a variety of natural phenomena and has significant implications in areas like astronomy (e.g., redshift) and radar speed detection.	
cranial-index	1842	Cranial Index	Following Blumenbach's idea of races, Retzius suggested a using the ratio of skull width to skull length. An index of less than .8 was called dolichocephalic (long head) and greater was called brachycephalic (broad head). This failed attempt to split the human species into smaller groups only encouraged racism and ethnocentricity.	Anders Adolf Retzius	Sweden	races	Science		
mechanical-equivalent-of-heat	1843	Mechanical equivalent of heat	This concept established the relationship between mechanical work and heat, demonstrating that energy could be converted from one form to another but not created or destroyed. It was a foundational principle in the field of thermodynamics that quantified the amount of work needed to produce a specific quantity of heat.	James Prescott Joule	England	conservation-of-mass	Science	A British physicist decided to explore the relationship between work and heat through extensive experimentation. In 1843, he published findings that quantified the amount of work needed to generate a specific quantity of heat, an effort which established the mechanical equivalent of heat. This principle underpinned the conservation of energy and contributed significantly to the field of thermodynamics.	
sunspot-cycle	1843	Sunspot cycle	The periodic change in the sun's activity, including variations in the number of sunspots and a 10-year cycle (later refined to 11-year on average) was characterized during this time.	Samuel Heinrich Schwabe	Germany	sunspots	Space	While sunspots were initially observed by Galileo, it wasn't until this period that the cyclic nature of sunspot activity began to attract attention. The understanding that sunspots increased and decreased in a somewhat regular cycle imparted vital insights into solar behavior and its potential impact on Earth.	
quaternions	1843	Quaternions	Quaternions are an extension of complex numbers represented as points involving four numbers, which revolutionized three-dimensional computations and physics. They provided a new mathematical framework, paving the way for future developments in algebra and geometry.	William Rowan Hamilton	Ireland	imaginary-numbers	Math	In 1843, it was shown that complex numbers could be treated as points in a plane, and that each could be represented by two numbers. Hamilton tried to deal with hypercomplex numbers that could be represented as points in three or more dimensions and devised quaternions, represented by four numbers.	
higher-analytic-geometry	1843	Higher analytic geometry	Higher analytic geometry is an extension to n-dimensional spaces, providing a fundamental tool in understanding geometric properties and behaviors beyond two and three dimensions. It built upon previous work in analytic geometry and increased the potential for mathematical exploration in multiple dimensions.	Arthur Cayley	England	analytic-geometry, quaternions	Math	In 1843, Cayley worked out analytic geometry in three or more dimensions, which would be called n-dimensional analytic geometry. This was based on extending analytic geometry work in two dimensions, expressed by algebraic equations.	
wheatstone-bridge	1843	Wheatstone bridge	The Wheatstone Bridge (named after its popularizer, not original inventor) is an electrical circuit used to measure unknown electrical resistances with high accuracy. It became a critical instrument in scientific research and electrical engineering.	Charles Wheatstone	England	ohms-law	Design	In 1843, the Wheatstone Bridge, although not invented by Wheatstone himself, garnered recognition when it became popular and widely introduced by him. The Wheatstone bridge measures the resistance of a circuit very delicately by balancing a number of currents against each other.	
transatlantic-liner	1843	Transatlantic liner	The S.S. Great Britain is recognized as the first modern ocean liner, featuring an iron hull and a screw propeller, marking the start of a new era in transatlantic travel. It significantly improved maritime transport efficiency and comfort, influencing future ship design.	Isambard Kingdom Brunel	England	screw-propeller, ocean-navigation	Design	The first ship seen as a modern transatlantic liner was the S.S. Great Britain, launched on July 19, 1843. It was 322 feet long, had a crew of 130, and featured an iron hull and screw propeller, setting new standards for shipbuilding and transoceanic travel.	
telegraph	1844	Telegraph	The telegraph is a communication system that transmits textual messages through electrical signals over wires. It facilitated rapid long-distance communication and had a significant impact on many aspects of society, including commerce, news dissemination, and military operations.	Samuel Morse	United States	morse-code, electromagnets	Science	In order to maintain the signal over long distances, the telegraph used a relay system invented in 1835. Electricity would pass through a wire, activating an electromagnet to pull on a telegraph key. This action would close a second circuit with its own battery, allowing a strong enough signal to engage another relay and continue the message transmission. Thus, messages could be relayed over vast distances by a network of wires and relays, providing nearly instantaneous communication across extended regions.	
companion-of-sirius	1844	Companion of Sirius	Astronomers discovered a companion star to Sirius, indicating that some stars have dark companions which are not luminous enough to be visible. This discovery suggested that stars can be influenced by gravitational pull from unseen objects, a concept which extended our understanding of stellar systems and their components.	Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel	Germany	stellar-motion, distance-of-stars	Space	The Companion of Sirius refers to the discovery of a star in close proximity to Sirius that followed an irregular path, suggesting the presence of an unseen gravitational influence. Astronomers like Bessel surmised that the erratic motions of certain stars near the end of their lives, such as Sirius and Procyon, indicated they were being influenced by unseen, non-luminous companions—later understood to be white dwarf stars or other dark celestial bodies.	
astraea	1845	Astraea	Astraea is an asteroid discovered after a long systematic search, marking the first newfound asteroid in nearly four decades and rekindling interest in asteroid hunting.	Karl Ludwig Hencke	Germany	asteroids	Space	The German amateur astronomer Karl Ludwig Hencke conducted a systematic search after 1830 and, after fifteen years of failure, discovered the asteroid named Astraea in 1845. This discovery came after a significant hiatus since the discovery of the first four asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta), challenging the assumption that no other asteroids existed.	
spiral-nebulas	1845	Spiral nebulas	Using a telescope with a 72" wide mirror, Parsons observed spiral structures in certain nebulas provided a new understanding of galactic formations and laid the groundwork for future astronomical discoveries.	William Parsons	Ireland	nebular-hypothesis	Space	Before 1845, nebulae in the sky appeared amorphous without discernible structure. However, observations made in 1845, using more advanced telescopes, revealed that some nebulae had spiral structures, a significant breakthrough in astronomy that hinted at the complex composition of distant galaxies.	
permanent-gases	1845	Permanent gases	The term 'permanent gases' was coined for a group of gases that resisted liquefaction under higher pressures, challenging chemists with new boundaries of chemical experimentation.	Michael Faraday	England	liquefying-gases	Science	In 1845, Michael Faraday's experiments to liquefy gases previously thought impossible to liquify, such as oxygen and nitrogen, resulted in the identification of these gases which remained gaseous under the conditions applied. This discovery influenced future research and methods for gas manipulation and contributed to the advancement of physical chemistry.	
anesthesia	1846	Anesthesia	The development of anesthesia involved the use of substances such as ether to induce unconsciousness and sensitize patients for pain-free operations. It revolutionized medicine by allowing more complex and longer surgeries to be performed without causing pain to the patient.	William Thomas Green Morton	United States	chloroform, hypnotism	Science	The development of anesthesia involved the use of substances such as ether to induce unconsciousness and sensitize patients for pain-free operations. While initial experiments were conducted in the 1840s, it wasn't until an American dentist, William Thomas Green Morton, publicly demonstrated the use of ether on a patient in 1846 that the practice was adopted into mainstream medicine.	
neptune	1846	Neptune	Neptune is a distant planet discovered due to irregularities in Uranus's orbit, which suggested the gravitational influence of another planet. It was observed for the first time in 1846, helped by calculations of its possible location due to these perturbations.	John Couch Adams, Urbain-Joseph Le Verrier	England, France	uranus	Space	The planet Uranus was found to have irregularities in its orbit, leading astronomers to predict the presence of Neptune based on gravitational influences on Uranus. Initial predictions were made and refined leading to the eventual observation of the planet in 1846, confirming the existence of the then-unknown planet. Neptune was named after the Roman god of the sea and was significant for showing that objects in our solar system could still be discovered.	
vulcan	1846	Vulcan	Vulcan was a hypothetical planet proposed to exist inside Mercury's orbit to account for peculiarities in Mercury's orbit, suggested by its perihelion shift. The planet was never found and the anomalies in Mercury's remained a mystery for seventy years.	Urbain-Joseph Le Verrier	France	neptune	Space	The search for Vulcan arose from the observation of Mercury's orbit behaving in a way not entirely explained by Newtonian mechanics. The planet Vulcan was postulated to exist closer to the Sun than Mercury. The concept was seriously considered following its proposal, with an aim to seek the planet beginning in 1846, but it was ultimately concluded to not exist after the phenomenon was explained by Einstein's theory.	
crystal-asymmetry	1846	Crystal asymmetry	Molecular asymmetry was discovered as a fundamental characteristic in certain molecules that can cause polarized light to twist in different directions. This discovery laid the groundwork for the field of stereochemistry several decades later.	Louis Pasteur	France	plane-of-polarized-light	Science	In 1846, a breakthrough in understanding molecular structure was achieved when it was found that certain organic molecules called tartarates could twist polarized light clockwise or counterclockwise depending on their asymmetrical structure. The study revealed that two forms of the same substance could have opposite optical effects, which was later understood to be due to the presence of chirality, a concept crucial to stereochemistry.	
protoplasm	1846	Protoplasm	Protoplasm was identified as the vital substance within plant cells responsible for various aspects of life, including growth and development. The discovery of protoplasm enhanced the understanding of the fundamental makeup of cell structure.	Hugo von Mohl	Germany	cell-theory	Science	Hugo von Mohl (1805–1872), a German botanist, discovered that typical plant cells contain a granular colloidal substance, which he termed protoplasm in 1846. This material, which comprises the living part of the cell, was recognized for its essential role in cell function, representing a significant advancement in cell biology and physiology.	
cuneiform-decipherment	1846	Cuneiform decipherment	The decipherment of cuneiform script opened up understanding of ancient Mesopotamian cultures, providing insight into their language, history, and civilization. This linguistic breakthrough enabled the translation of countless tablets and inscribed artifacts.	Henry Rawlinson	England	rosetta-stone	Geography	In the 19th century, cuneiform, an ancient writing system used in Mesopotamia, was deciphered by linguists and archaeologists. Henry Rawlinson, a British army officer and scholar, played a pivotal role in this achievement, leading to a significant expansion of knowledge about early human civilizations.	
sewing-machine	1846	Sewing machine	The sewing machine was devised to make a device small enough for the home that could sew stitches using a needle and a shuttle. It revolutionized home and industrial sewing, greatly reducing the time and effort required for creating garments.	Elias Howe	United States	jacquard-loom	Design	Prior to the invention of the sewing machine, weaving machines for cloth patterns existed, but there was a need for a more compact and convenient device for use in the home. The first successful model that caught on used a needle and shuttle to create stitches and outperformed manual sewing methods, hence gaining popularity and becoming a key product of the Industrial Revolution that eased household sewing tasks.	
conservation-of-energy	1847	Conservation of energy	This fundamental principle states that the total amount of energy in the Universe is constant, where energy cannot be created or destroyed but can change forms, such as between mechanical, electrical, and chemical energies. The law signifies a foundational concept in the field of physics and underscores the interconvertibility of various forms of energy.	Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz	Germany	mechanical-equivalent-of-heat	Science	The law of conservation of energy, proposed in the mid-19th century, asserts that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant over time. It indicates that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transferred or transformed from one form to another. This principle has become a cornerstone of physics, guiding the understanding of energy dynamics across all natural processes.	
puerperal-fever	1847	Puerperal fever	Puerperal fever is an infection that historically affected childbearing women, often leading to severe illness and death, and it was discovered that cross-contamination from doctors treating multiple patients could exacerbate the spread of the disease. The recognition of this contagious nature of the fever prompted improved sanitary practices in medical care.	Ignaz Phillipp Semmelweiss 	Hungary	pathology	Science	The recognition of puerperal fever, or childbed fever, as a contagious condition marked an important step in medical science, emphasizing the importance of hygiene and sanitation in the prevention of the spread of infections. This discovery led to the understanding that doctors could inadvertently transfer bacteria from one patient to another, influencing the development of antiseptic techniques and a shift toward better sanitary practices in hospitals and childbirth procedures.	
painless-childbirth	1847	Painless childbirth	The invention allowed for painless childbirth by using a certain anesthesia, which was a groundbreaking advancement for obstetrics.	James Young Simpson	England	screw-propeller	Science	A British obstetrician discovered the ability to administer anaesthesia to women in childbirth, providing a much less dangerous and traumatic experience than the prevalent methods at the time. This practice was adopted quickly and became a transformative development for both healthcare providers and expectant mothers.	
nitroglycerine	1847	Nitroglycerine	Initially discovered by accidentally mixing nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table, nitroglycerine was further improved and stabilized to be used in construction and warfare, hence beginning the modern era of explosives.	Christian Friedrich Schönbein	Germany	gunpowder	Science	Initially discovered by Christian Friedrich Schönbein when he accidentally created a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table, nitroglycerine was further improved and stabilized to be used in construction and warfare, hence beginning the modern era of explosives.	
symbolic-logic	1847	Symbolic logic	Symbolic Logic is a system that leverages symbols and operations analogous to algebra to represent and solve logical arguments. Its development has essential applications in areas such as mathematics and computer programming.	George Boole	England	calculus	Math	In 1847, George Boole published 'The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,' formulating a system that applies a set of symbols to logical operations. This method resembles algebra, allowing logical arguments to be manipulated and solved symbolically, which laid the groundwork for later developments in mathematics and computer science.	
silver-fillings	1847	Silver fillings	Silver fillings are a dental innovation enabling the restoration of teeth damaged by decay. This technique involves filling the cavities with silver amalgam to prevent further deterioration.	Thomas Wilberger Evans	United States	dentistry	Science	Thomas Wilberger Evans introduced the use of silver amalgam for fillings in 1847. This method restored teeth that had cavities due to decay, offering a durable solution for maintaining dental health.	
absolute-zero	1848	Absolute zero	Absolute Zero is the theoretical lowest temperature possible, where gas volume decreases to zero and all thermal motion ceases. The Kelvin scale measures the Celsius degree of heat that the freezing point of water would be 273.15 K, and it has since been essential in thermodynamics for providing an absolute scale.	Baron Kelvin	England	gas-volume-temperature, celsius	Science	British physicist William Thomson, later known as Baron Kelvin, pointed out in 1848 the significance of energy loss affecting not only gases but also liquids and solids. The concept of Absolute Zero reflects a state where temperature can be indefinitely lowered, and all kinetic activity halts, leading to the Kelvin scale of temperature.	
crab-nebula	1848	Crab Nebula	Using large new telescopes, the Crab Nebula was identified as a remnant of a bright new star first observed in 1054. It was noted for its irregular shape resembling a crab. Its study has been instrumental in astronomical research and has solidified the importance of the event it represents in history.	Lord Rosse	England	spiral-nebulas	Space	In 1848, using a giant telescope, Lord Rosse studied the first nebulosity (M1) on the list Messier had prepared since 1771. He observed a patch of a curiously irregular shape that seemed to have numerous crooked legs like those of a crab, leading him to call it the 'Crab nebula'—a name that has been preserved. This marked an important step in understanding the remnants of supernovas and their role in the cosmos.	
spectral-line-shift	1848	Spectral line shift	The spectral line shift or Doppler-Fizeau effect describes the change in wavelength and frequency of light from a source due to its relative motion, which impacts the study of motion and velocity in astronomy. The red shift indicates objects in space receding from the viewer, while the blue shift suggests an approaching motion.	Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau	France	doppler-effect	Science	Building on the Doppler effect with respect to sound that had been described in 1842, physicist Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau proposed in 1848 that the concept could be applied to the waves of light as well. This shift in light's spectral lines could show a shift towards red if the light source is receding or a shift towards blue in case of an approaching light source, enabling better understanding of the universe's expansion and motion of celestial bodies.	
speed-of-light-experiment	1849	Speed of light experiment	The speed of light was determined more accurately using an earthbound experiment involving a toothed wheel and mirrors. Foucault's best figure was off by just 0.7 percent. He also found that light traveling through water traveled only three-fourths as fast as through air.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	speed-of-light, aberration-light, spectral-line-shift	Science	Using an improved method involving a toothed wheel and two mirrors, one stationary and the other rotating, scientists were able to measure the speed of light with increased precision. Light was reflected from the stationary mirror to the rotating one and the timing of the reflection was measured, which allowed for a more accurate speed of light calculation.	
roche-limit	1849	Roche limit	The Roche limit refers to the critical distance within which celestial bodies, like Saturn's rings, would disintegrate due to tidal forces rather than accrete into a larger body due to gravitational attraction. This concept explains why certain astronomical bodies form rings instead of coalescing into moons or planets.	Edouard Roche	France	universal-gravitation, saturn-rings	Space	The Roche Limit is a concept in celestial mechanics introduced in 1849. It addresses the effect of tidal forces on an object when it is in a close orbital proximity to a larger body, such as a planet. If an object, such as a satellite or ring particle, orbits within this limit, tidal forces overcome the gravitational forces holding it together, and it may break up and disperse, often forming rings rather than a single body. The Roche Limit has helped to understand the formation and nature of rings around planets like Saturn.	
nerve-fibers	1849	Nerve fibers	Discovery that nerve fibers are prolonged outgrowths of cells strengthened the cell theory, highlighting the direct extension of cells in the formation of nerves. This finding contributed significantly to the understanding of the nervous system structure.	Rudolf Albert von Kölliker	Germany	cell-theory	Science	In 1849, it was revealed that nerve fibers are actually elongated outgrowths of cells. This discovery was pivotal as it supported and reinforced the developing cell theory, illustrating that not only do cells serve as the fundamental units of life, they also directly extend to form more complex structures such as the nerves in the nervous system. Prior to this, the composition of nerves and how they related to cells were not fully understood.	
safety-pin	1849	Safety Pin	Improved pin design included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place.	Walter Hunt	United States	steel	Design		
reinforced-concrete	1849	Reinforced Concrete	Monier, a commercial gardener, experimented with iron-wire reinforcement for his cement and concrete tubs and basins, making it much stronger.	Joseph Monier	France	steel	Design		
second-law-of-thermodynamics	1850	Second law of thermodynamics	The Second Law of Thermodynamics formalizes the observation that energy in a closed system tends to become less useful over time, a concept also known as entropy. This principle is fundamental in predicting the direction of natural processes and understanding the limits of energy conversion and work.	Rudolf Clausius	Germany	conservation-of-energy, steam-engine-efficiency, thermochemistry	Science	After the establishment of the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is the law of conservation of energy, the Second Law points out that in any closed system, no energy can be destroyed, but it tends to be spread out and degraded over time, leaving less and less energy in a useful form. German physicist Rudolf Clausius, and later, physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, contributed to refining this concept, stating that while energy remains constant, the entropy of the universe always increases, leading to a gradual decay of available energy for doing work.	
infrared-waves	1850	Infrared waves	The discovery of infrared waves unveiled a type of radiation beyond the visible spectrum, detectable due to its heating effects and possessing similar wave properties as visible light. This discovery broadened the understanding of electromagnetic radiation and led to the development of various applications utilizing infrared technology.	Macedonio Melloni	Italy	infrared-radiation	Science	Infrared waves were discovered as a form of light that lies outside the visible spectrum, characterized by longer wavelengths that can cause heating effects and are detectable by sensitive instruments. The detection and study of infrared radiation opened new avenues in scientific research and practical applications, such as thermal imaging and remote sensing.	
rotation-of-the-earth	1851	Rotation of the earth	Ever since the time of Copernicus, it had been assumed that the Earth rotates on its axis, but no one had proven it. Foucault suspended a large iron ball inside the dome of a large church. The pendulum ended in a spike that would mark the floor as it swung, showing the changing orientation of the swing.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	heliocentric-practice	Science	Ever since the time of Copernicus, it had been assumed that the Earth rotates on its axis, but no one had proven it. In 1851, Foucault suspended a large iron ball inside the dome of a large church. The pendulum ended in a spike that would mark the floor as it swung, demonstrating Earth's rotation by the changing orientation of the pendulum's swing. The experiment showed that in Paris, it would take 31 hours and 47 minutes for the pendulum to complete a full rotation, visually proving Earth's rotation to observers.	
ariel-and-umbriel	1851	Ariel and umbriel	Lassell discovered a third and fourth satellite of Uranus, naming them after spirits in English literature (Shakespeare and Pope).	William Lassell	England	uranus-satellites	Space	The last large satellite, Triton, had been discovered five years before 1851, but there were smaller satellites to be found. In 1848, Lassell had discovered an eighth satellite of Saturn named Hyperion. The year 1851 saw the discovery of two more satellites by an American astronomer, Ariel and Umbriel, adding to the growing knowledge of planetary satellites.	
joule-thomson-effect	1852	Joule-thomson effect	The Joule-Thomson effect demonstrated how a gas cools when it expands if kept insulated from external energy sources. This effect later facilitated the liquefaction of permanent gases.	James Prescott Joule and William Thomson	England	second-law-of-thermodynamics	Science	In 1852, Joule and Thomson were able to show that if a gas was allowed to expand, it consumed energy, because the molecules had to separate against a certain tendency to cling together. If energy were kept from entering the gas, the energy for expansion would have to come from the gas itself, and the temperature would drop. This came to be called the Joule-Thomson effect and would later be used to liquefy some of the permanent gases.	
valence-theory	1852	Valence theory	The valence theory explained how elements combine with fixed numbers of other atoms according to specific rules. The notion of valence imposed a new kind of order on the elements, because valence seemed to change regularly with the arrangement of atoms in the periodic table.	Edward Frankland	England	atomic-theory	Science	Chemists knew that elements had different capacities for combining with other elements. For instance, an oxygen atom would combine with two hydrogen atoms to form water, a nitrogen atom would combine with three hydrogen atoms to form ammonia, and a carbon atom would combine with four hydrogen atoms to form methane. This was not studied closely and systematically, however, until an English chemist, Edward Frankland, studied organometallic compounds. He could not help noticing the manner in which metallic atoms combined with organic compounds, and how each different kind of atom would almost invariably hook onto a fixed number of other atom groupings. In 1852 he published his theory of what came to be called valence, pointing out that a particular atom had the power to combine with fixed numbers of other kinds of atoms according to simple rules. The notion of valence imposed a new kind of order on the elements, because valence seemed to change regularly with the arrangement of atoms in the periodic table.	
gyroscope	1852	Gyroscope	A massive rotating sphere that maintains its axis of spin direction, used for steady navigation. It provided a more reliable means of indicating true north than the magnetic compass.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	rotation-of-the-earth, compass	Science	A demonstration was made with a heavy rim (a gyroscope) set to rapid rotation. It maintained its axial direction even when tipped, counteracting gravity to maintain steady orientation, thus substituting the magnetic compass for accurate navigation.	
sunspots-and-earth	1852	Sunspots and earth	The discovery linked disturbances in Earth's magnetic field with the increase and decrease of sunspots on the Sun. This finding was pivotal in showing that Earth's magnetic properties were influenced by solar activity.	Edward Sabine	England	earth-magnet, sunspot-cycle	Space	Research demonstrated that the frequency of disturbances in Earth's magnetic field paralleled the increase and decrease of sunspots. It established the first known connection between Earth and Sun involving something other than light, heat, or gravitational pull, indicating that sunspots had magnetic properties.	
elevators	1852	Elevators	The invention of the mechanical elevator with a safety guard revolutionized urban architecture by allowing buildings to rise to greater heights. This innovation enabled the construction of skyscrapers and transformed city landscapes.	Elisha Graves Otis	United States	reinforced-concrete	Design	Spearheading the creation of an elevator with an adequate safety guard, the device prevented the elevator from falling if its supporting cable severed. A public demonstration in 1854 showed the inventor safely ascending and descending after cutting the cable, proving the system's safety and functionality.	
age-of-the-sun	1853	Age of the sun	The Sun's energy source was identified as gravitational collapse rather than combustion, leading to the conclusion that the Sun is millions of years old and will eventually become too cool to support life on Earth. This challenged the belief that the Sun was eternal and suggested that Earth is much older than previously believed.	Hermann von Helmholtz	Germany	conservation-of-energy, biblical-age-of-earth	Space	It had been assumed for thousands of years that the Sun was eternal, unchanged, and only God could end it. The discovery of sunspots began to question this belief. With the law of conservation of energy established, scientists queried how the Sun could shine brilliantly for millions of years. Helmholtz proposed gravitational contraction as the energy source. This implied that the Sun had been gradually contracting for about twenty-five million years, and in another ten million years, it would be too small and cool to support life, indicating that the Earth is much older than twenty-five million years.	
glider	1853	Glider	Cayley created the first glider capable of sustaining flight through wind and updrafts. He forced his coachman take the first flight, flying 500 yards and surviving. This laid the foundation for the development of airplanes.	George Cayley	England	aerodynamics, hot-air-balloon	Science: Physics	Balloons existed for seventy years, showing that objects heavier than air could stay aloft under certain conditions. George Cayley scientifically studied these conditions, founding the science of aerodynamics. He discovered that fixed wings, like those on squirrels, were needed for flight, along with innovations in design including wings, tail, streamlined fuselage, and rudder. Realizing a suitable engine for powered flight wasn't yet available, he constructed a first glider in 1853, capable of gliding with wind and updrafts.	
kerosene	1853	Kerosene	A novel process to yield an inflammable liquid from asphalt became vital for lamps. It was crucial for illumination in Europe and America despite the challenge of producing sufficient quantities.	Abraham Gesner	Canada	gas-lighting	Science:Chemistry	In 1853 a British physician, Abraham Gesner, developed a process that would yield an inflammable liquid from asphalt. Because it was driven out of a waxy mixture of solid hydrocarbons, Gesner called the liquid kerosene, from a Greek word for 'wax.' Kerosene proved ideal for lamps, but even with Gesner’s process, enough kerosene could not be produced to meet the great demands represented by the lamps of Europe and America.	
cholera	1854	Cholera	Through studying a cholera epidemic, Snow identified contaminated water as the source of the Cholera disease, shaping future concepts of epidemiology and public health sanitation.	John Snow	England		Science:Medicine	In the early nineteenth century, Europe suffered from several cholera epidemics that arrived from India, where it was endemic. Increasingly, physicians were sure that the contagion arose from polluted water. An English physician, John Snow, had published his views on this matter in 1849. When an epidemic of cholera struck London in 1854, Snow studied the geographic incidence of cholera in relation to water supply. He found five hundred cases of cholera, for instance, within a few blocks of a public water pump that drew water from a well just a few feet from a sewer pipe. He had the pump handle removed, and	
telegraph-plateau	1854	Telegraph plateau	Laying cables across the Atlantic Ocean to connect Europe and America necessitated understanding the ocean floor. American oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury identified a central plateau, naming it the Telegraph Plateau, essential for cable laying.	Matthew Fontaine Maury	England	ocean-navigation, telegraph	Geography	With cables laid across the Hudson and Mississippi rivers in the 1840s and under the English Channel and the Irish Sea in the 1850s, it became natural to think of a real job, that of laying a cable under the Atlantic Ocean to connect Europe and America. The process of laying such a cable required some understanding of what the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was like, and the task fell to the American oceanographer Maury. In the early 1850s he had prepared a chart of ocean depths, and by 1854 he had noted that the Atlantic Ocean was shallower in the center than on either side. He concluded that there was a central plateau, which he called Telegraph Plateau.	
riemann-geometry	1854	Riemann geometry	Riemann generalized geometry to work with any number of dimensions, building on Lobachevsky and Bolay. He created self-consistent models where all lines intersect and all lines are finite in length, extending geometry's scope beyond traditional Euclidean limitations. 	Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann	Germany	non-euclidean-geometry	Math:Geometry	The non-Euclidean geometry worked out by Lobachevsky and Bolyai presupposed the possibility of more than one line through a point, all parallel to a given line that did not include the point. As in Euclidean geometry, lines of infinite length were possible. In 1854 a German mathematician, Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, developed another kind of non-Euclidean geometry, one in which it was impossible for any two lines to be parallel, and all lines intersected. In this geometry all lines were finite in length. In Euclidean geometry, the three angles of a triangle add up to 360 degrees; in Lobachevskian geometry, they add up to less than 360 degrees; and in Riemannian geometry, they add up to more than 360 degrees. Riemann's geometry is perfectly reasonable and self-consistent. He generalized geometry to the point where he considered it in any number of dimensions. He also considered situations in which measurements changed from point to point in space but in such a way that one could transform one set of measurements into another according to a fixed rule. At the time, this sounded like pure abstraction, but half a century later, Riemannian geometry was shown to represent a truer picture of the Universe than did Euclid's geometry, thanks to the theory of general relativity.	
lines-of-force	1855	Lines of force	Faraday introduced the concept of lines of force but knowing no math could only describe it pictorally. Maxwell translated it into mathematical form.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	electric-generators	Science:Physics	Faraday introduced the concept of lines of force, which he could only describe pictorially due to a lack of mathematical knowledge. In 1855, British mathematician James Clerk Maxwell managed to translate this concept into a mathematical form, demonstrating that Faraday's intuitive grasp of the subject was accurate.	
geissler-tubes	1855	Geissler tubes	The invention introduced improved vacuum tubes which led to advances in studying atomic structures. Utilizing mercury columns to create a superior vacuum, these tubes were more effectively evacuated compared to prior versions.	Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler	Germany	barometer	Science:Physics	Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler designed an air pump that did not require mechanical parts, using a mercury column to create a vacuum. These Geissler tubes were significantly more evacuated and transparent, aiding in future atomic structure studies.	
seismograph	1855	Seismograph	The first crude seismograph was invented to detect small tremors using horizontal tubes partly filled with mercury. Although not highly effective initially, it marked the beginning of earthquake monitoring equipment.	Luigi Palmieri	Italy	earthquakes, mercury-thermometer	Science:Geology	Luigi Palmieri invented the initial seismograph to detect minor earthquakes. It used horizontal tubes turned up at the ends and correctly filled with mercury; small iron floats would move with the tremors, allowing an estimate of their scale and intensity.	
pyroxylin	1855	Pyroxylin	A British chemist discovered that pyroxilin, if dissolved in alcohol, ether and camphor, would produce a hard solid upon evaporation. He found no practical application of this, but discovered the first synthetic plastic.	Alexander Parkes	England	cellulose	Science:Chemistry	Alexander Parkes discovered pyroxylin, a chemical compound that was instrumental in the development of new materials. This compound would later lead to the creation of celluloid, a precursor to modern plastics.	
glycogen	1856	Glycogen	Glycogen is a form of starch discovered in the mammalian liver that is easily broken down into glucose. This discovery showed that both plants and animals build up and break down complex molecules for energy storage and usage.	Claude Bernard	France	diabetes	Science:BiologyUntil now, starch had been viewed as the plant's way of storing energy. Animals tend to store it as fat (as some plants do too), which is a more compact form of energy. In 1856, however, the French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813–1878) discovered a form of starch in the mammalian liver. Because it was easily broken down to glucose (the immediate energy source in the bloodstream), he called it glycogen (Greek for 'glucose-producer'). He showed that glycogen was built up out of blood glucose and acted as a reserve store that could be broken down to glucose again when necessary. Whether glycogen was built up or broken down depended on the exact state of the body, the energy requirements of the various tissues, the food supply in the intestines, and so on. The net result was that the glycogen balance was so maneuvered that the sugar content in the blood remained steady. Until then, it was supposed that plants built up complex molecules (anabolism) and that animals tore them down (catabolism). Bernard's work showed that animals built up complex molecules as well, and as time went on, it appeared that both plants and animals built up and broke down substances as needed. What was different between them was that the build-up in plants was through solar energy, while in animals, the build-up was through chemical energy from food, the food being obtained eventually if not directly, from plants.		
bessemer-steel	1856	Bessemer steel	A new steel making process allowed for the removal of excess carbon in cast iron, creating tough, hard steel more cheaply. This innovation paved the way for the construction of infrastructure such as buildings and elevators in the next century.	Henry Bessemer	England	coke-iron, oxygen	Science:Metallurgy	The Bessemer process involves burning off carbon from cast iron more cheaply by using a blast of air through molten iron. By optimizing the combination of oxygen from the air and carbon in the iron, this method allowed for the economical production of durable steel, which was essential for building the cities of the future.	
synthetic-dyes	1856	Synthetic dyes	Attempting to synthesize quinine, an accidental creation of synthetic dyes revolutionized the textile industry by providing a wide array of colors that were previously difficult to achieve. 	William Henry Perkin	England	dye, quinine	Science:Chemistry	William Henry Perkin accidentally discovered mauve dye while attempting to synthesize quinine. This innovation led him to establish a dye manufacturing industry, which met great commercial success and transformed the world of fashion with synthetic colors.	
neanderthal-man	1856	Neanderthal man	The discovery of Neanderthal bones in Neander Valley in Germany provided key insights into human evolution. This finding helped establish the understanding that humans have ancient origins and are part of a long lineage.	Pierre-Paul Broca	France	biblical-age-of-earth	Science:Archaeology	In Neander Valley, Germany, workers found ancient bones, including a skull, which were identified by a professor at a nearby school. This significant discovery contributed to the fields of geology and biology, confirming the ancient age of Earth and early human ancestors.	
pasteurization	1856	Pasteurization	Pasteurization is a process that heats liquids to a specific temperature to kill harmful microorganisms, preventing spoilage and disease. It revolutionized the wine industry and later the dairy industry by making products safer for consumption.	Louis Pasteur	France	fermentation, bacteria	Science:Microbiology	French wine was turning sour as it aged, causing significant losses. Through his research, Pasteur found that wine contained different types of yeast cells, and by heating the wine to about 50°C, he could kill the yeast cells without affecting the wine's taste. This method, called pasteurization, was eventually applied to milk to prevent the spread of diseases caused by contaminated dairy products. It had a significant impact on food safety and led to further advancements in microbiology.	
saturns-rings-composition	1857	Saturn's rings composition	Saturn's rings were hypothesized to be composed of myriad small particles. Maxwell confirmed this using Roche's limit, solidifying the theory.	James Clerk Maxwell	Scotland	roche-limit	Space	By this time, it seemed very likely that Saturn's rings were composed of myriads of small particles. Since they were inside Roche's limit, solid particles would break up under tidal influences and be unable to coalesce again. In 1857, Maxwell showed that this was indeed so, based on purely theoretical considerations, and no one has doubted it since.	
evolution-by-natural-selection	1858	Evolution by natural selection	Natural selection explained how some species evolve into other related species while others become extinct, driven by the competition for survival. This theory posited that nature selects the fittest individuals to survive and pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring.	Charles Robert Darwin	England	population-growth-theory	Science:Biology	The British biologist Charles Robert Darwin believed that life forms had evolved; that some species, with time, changed into other related species, while some species became extinct. Darwin theorized that not only human beings multiplied past the food supply available, but that all living things did. Therefore, in each generation, there was a competition for survival among the too-many, and those tended to survive who could snatch enough food, or best evade a predator. In short, nature itself would select a few from the many for survival. The characteristics that made survival likely would be inherited by the offspring of the survivors and again there would be a natural selection. Darwin assumed that there were always variations among offspring, random and tiny variations perhaps, and that nature then used those variations as a means of selection, so to speak. The 'better' among the variations would not always do better, since there was always the factor of chance, but on the whole, and in the long run, they would.	
organic-molecular-structure	1858	Organic molecular structure	A major advancement in understanding molecular structure, highlighting the arrangement of atoms within compounds using the concept of valence. This system introduced notation: Water would be H—O—H, and carbon dioxide O=C=O, clarifying the organization of organic molecules, resolving many mysteries of organic chemistry.	August Kekulé	Germany	valence-theory	Science:Chemistry	Until this point, organic molecules were characterized solely by the number of atoms of each element present. Even with isomers showing identical atom counts but different properties, it was unclear how to distinguish these differences. Friedrich August Kekulé expanded on Frankland's idea of valence, illustrating how each hydrogen atom could bond to others and how atoms within molecules can form complex structures by latching onto valence bonds. This led to the clarification of organic molecules' structures and the resolution of many mysteries in organic chemistry.	
cellular-pathology	1858	Cellular pathology	Further development of cell theory, emphasizing the importance of cells in pathology. This advancement strengthened the concept that all diseases involve changes at the cellular level, and opposed the idea of spontaneous generation.	Rudolph Virchow	Germany	cell-theory, pathology, no-spontaneous-generation-redux	Science:Biology	Building on the cell theory, which emerged in 1838, Rudolph Virchow continued to refine our understanding of pathology by stressing that all diseases are manifestations of changes in cells. This insight provided a crucial framework for modern medical practices, making it possible to relate clinical symptoms and pathological findings to cellular alterations.	
refrigerators	1858	Refrigerators	Refrigerators are devices that lower temperatures to keep food from spoiling by using the principle of evaporative cooling. They evolved from bulky and inconvenient devices into almost universal household appliances over approximately seventy-five years.	Ferdinand Carré	France	liquefying-gases	General	Reducing food to a low temperature kept it from spoiling, and in early times, natural ice was used for the purpose. In the early nineteenth century, mechanical refrigerators were developed by liquefying gases to lower temperature and condensing them to pump out heat. Ferdinand Carré designed the first successful commercial refrigerator in 1858 using water; he switched to ammonia in 1859 which was more efficient. Though initially used industrially for ice-making and meat-packing, they eventually became convenient for household use after extensive improvements.	
electricity-in-a-vacuum	1858	Electricity in a vacuum	The study of electricity in a vacuum involves observing electric currents in evacuated vessels, leading to the discovery of fluorescence in a Geissler tube. This phenomenon, characterized by a greenish glow, resulted from the energetic collision of radiation with matter.	Julius Plücker	Germany	geissler-tubes, electrical-motion	Science:Physics	Occasionally, scientists attempted to force an electric current through a vacuum to study the electric fluid without interference. The phenomenon of fluorescence was first observed by Gabriel Stokes when an electric current was passed through vacuum-enclosed glass vessels. In 1858, Julius Plücker forced an electric current through a Geissler tube and observed the glowing fluorescence, which shifted due to an electromagnetic field. This discovery helped further the understanding of vacuums and electric currents.	
oil-wells	1859	Oil wells	This invention marked the first instance of drilling for oil, which was sometimes found on the surface, leading to the mass production of kerosene and other petroleum products. It utilized a method previously applied to brine drilling, significantly boosting oil availability and impacting various industries.	Edwin Laurentine Drake	United States	kerosene, oil-lamp	Science:Geology	Petroleum, a complex mixture of hydrocarbons from microorganisms' fat content, was previously extracted from the surface. It was discovered that drilling could access deeper, untapped reserves. Edwin Laurentine Drake utilized a method from brine drilling and drilled the first successful oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. This discovery led to the mass production of kerosene and spurred further oil drilling.	
storage-battery	1859	Storage battery	A reversible chemical reaction allowed rechargeable batteries to store electric current after being depleted. This invention provided a way to repeatedly charge and use batteries for electric power storage, paving the path for more efficient energy usage and storage solutions.	Gaston Planté	France	electric-battery	Science:Physics	All the electric batteries used in the six decades since Volta had invented the first one were one-shot affairs. The chemical reaction that gave rise to the electric current eventually proceeded to a point where it could no longer support current. It then had to be discarded, for the chemical reaction could not be reversed. Yet some chemical reactions are easily reversible. In 1859, a French physicist, Gaston Planté (1834-1889), took two sheets of lead, with an insulating sheet of rubber between them, rolled the lead sheets into a spiral, and upended it into dilute sulfuric acid. He found that a chemical reaction resulted that would produce an electric current. Furthermore, when the battery was discharged, an electric current could be forced through it in the opposite direction, and the chemical reaction would be reversed, so that the battery could eventually produce an electric current again. Naturally, we are not getting something for nothing. The second law of thermodynamics (see 1850) would not allow that. The electrical energy required to charge a storage battery is always greater than the amount it can then deliver. It would be a losing proposition, therefore, to charge a discharged storage battery from one that was fully charged. To charge a storage battery, you must get your electricity from a generator that makes use of fuel energy or some other nonelectrical source of energy.	
spectral-lines-and-elements	1859	Spectral lines and elements	Since their discovery by Fraunhofer nearly half a century before, spectral lines had not been connected with chemistry. The discovery that each element produces characteristic spectral lines when heated extended knowledge about chemical elements and their behaviors. This finding allowed for the identification of elements through their unique spectral fingerprints.	Gustav Robert Kirchhoff	Germany	spectral-lines	Science:Chemistry	Since their discovery by Fraunhofer nearly half a century before, spectral lines had not been connected with chemistry. The German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), however, had carefully studied the spectra of light produced when various elements were heated to incandescence. He found that each element produced light of only certain wavelengths, so that the spectrum consisted sometimes of only a few lines of light, which were sometimes well separated. In 1859 Kirchhoff announced that every element produced characteristic spectral lines, which it also absorbed when its vapors were cooler than the light source. The pattern of lines was different for each element; no two elements shared spectral lines in exactly the same positions. In essence, each element had a spectral 'fingerprint.' This meant that if any sample of ore, on being heated to incandescence, produced even a single spectral line in a position not recorded for any known element, then some new element must be present in that ore. Making use of such spectroscopic data, Kirchhoff discovered cesium in 1860. The name is derived from the Latin word for 'sky-blue,' since that was the color of the spectral line that had given away cesium's existence. The next year Kirchhoff discovered rubidium, a related element, its name coming from the Latin for 'red.' Kirchhoff also pointed out that the dark lines in the solar spectrum were the result of light being absorbed by the gases in the sun.	
solar-flares	1859	Solar flares	An astronomical observation identified solar flares, which are brief but violent explosions associated with sunspots. This discovery enhanced understanding of the Sun's activity, distinguishing between periods of high and low sunspot activity.	Richard Christopher Carrington	England	sunspot-cycle	Space	The British astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington observed the Sun's rotation by measuring sunspots. He noticed a bright point of light that lasted for five minutes and then subsided, which he initially speculated to be a falling meteor but later realized was a solar flare. This observation linked sunspots with solar flares and marked the understanding of 'active' and 'quiet' phases of the Sun based on sunspot activity.	
kinetic-theory-of-gases	1859	Kinetic theory of gases	Maxwell described the behavior of gases based on the movement and velocity distribution of their molecules. It provided a statistical approach to understanding how gas molecules behave differently depending on temperature and velocity, revolutionizing thermodynamics.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	boyles-law, thermochemistry, charles-law	Science:Physics	James Clerk Maxwell worked on mathematical relationships describing how the molecules of a gas move randomly at different speeds and bounce off walls with perfect elasticity. He discovered that the distribution of molecular velocities could be linked to the temperature and that gases can exhibit statistically significant deviations from expected behavior. This indicated that gases could sometimes defy the second law of thermodynamics, challenging existing theories.	
spontaneous-generation-rip	1860	Spontaneous generation R. I. P.	Pasteur's experiment conclusively demonstrated that life does not spontaneously arise from non-living matter. This was the nail in the coffin for the concept of spontaneous generation.	Louis Pasteur	France	no-spontaneous-generation-redux	Science:BiologyPasteur boiled meat extract and placed it in a flask with a long, curved neck that allowed air to enter but prevented dust particles from falling in. The meat extract did not spoil or develop microorganisms, disproving the theory of spontaneous generation and suggesting that dust carries microorganisms.		
internal-combustion-engine	1860	Internal-combustion engine	Instead of using steam to move a piston, what if flammable vapor and air could explode within a cylinder to move the piston instead? Although still too inefficient to be practical, this engine powered small vehicles and represented a significant step in the evolution of modern transportation.	Jean-Joseph-Étienne Lenoir	France	kinetic-theory-of-gases, steam-engine-efficiency	Design	Prior to the internal-combustion engine, steam engines were the primary source of mechanical power. Lenoir's invention harnessed the explosive force of flammable vapor mixed with air within a cylinder to move a piston directly. This compact and responsive engine was the precursor to the efficient internal-combustion engines that came thereafter, enabling the creation of horseless carriages and ultimately revolutionizing transportation.	
organic-synthesis	1860	Organic synthesis	Berthelot was able to synthesize organic molecules in a lab without the use of living matter. This advancement supported the development of organic chemistry and debunked the idea that only living tissue could manufacture complex organic molecules.	Pierre-Eugène-Marcelin Berthelot	France	synthetic-urea	Science: Chemistry	When Wöhler synthesized urea, it challenged the notion that complex organic molecules could only be produced by living organisms. Pierre-Eugène-Marcelin Berthelot furthered this field by synthesizing important organic compounds such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, methane, benzene, and acetylene by 1860. This led to the realization that the chemical structures and properties of organic molecules could be replicated outside of living systems, aiding the progression of organic chemistry.	
solar-prominences	1860	Solar prominences	Advancements in astronomical photography allowed for the detailed capture of solar phenomena. This included solar prominences which are gouts of flame around the edge of the sun during a total eclipse. This was the first astronomical discovery made as a result of photography, and required de la Rue to quickly travel to Spain.	Warren de la Rue	England	reflecting-telescope, photography, solar-flares, steam-locomotive-improved	Space	Through the use of a specially adapted telescope, the English astronomer Warren de la Rue excelled in photographing the Sun's phenomena. In 1860 during a trip to Spain, he captured an image of a total solar eclipse that clearly showed flame-like prominences extending from the sun. These images provided valuable insights into solar behavior and greatly improved the understanding of solar prominences.	
avogadro-revived	1860	Avogadro's hypothesis revived	Avogadro's hypothesis, revived by Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro, clarified that the molecular weight of gases can be determined with certainty, resolving much confusion in molecular structure.	Stanislao Cannizzaro	Italy	avogadro-hypothesis, organic-molecular-structure	Science:Chemistry	Avogadro's hypothesis, revived by Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro, clarified that the molecular weight of gases can be determined, resolving much confusion in molecular structure. Presented at an international conference of chemists in Karlsruhe, it gained acceptance and led to a general agreement over molecular structures.	
black-bodies	1860	Blackbody Radiation	The theory of black bodies, suggested by Kirchhoff, posits that a body absorbing all light and reflecting none, known as a black body, when heated, emits all wavelengths of light. This led to significant advancements in understanding light and temperature distribution across the spectrum.	Gustav Robert Kirchhoff	Germany	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Physics	The theory of black bodies, suggested by Kirchhoff, posits that a body absorbing all light and reflecting none, known as a black body, when heated, emits all wavelengths of light. This theory was a crucial advancement in physics, aiding the understanding of light wavelength emission and temperature distribution across the total spectrum, eventually leading to a major revolution in physics.	
archeopteryx	1861	Archeopteryx	Archeopteryx is a fossil representing an ancient life form that lies between dinosaurs and birds, showing evolutionary transition. It showcases a blend of lizard-like and avian features, highlighting the link between the two groups.	Hermann von Meyer	Germany	iguanodon, evolution-by-natural-selection	Science:Biology	Although the giant dinosaurs, whose fossil relics had been dug up over the past forty years, were the most dramatic remnants of ancient life, the most important single fossil was not a giant, but a relatively small lizardlike animal that was discovered in 1861. It left a clear impression in a rock, which showed that it had a head possessing teeth and a beak, a long neck, a long tail, and a flat breastbone—all very lizardlike. There was, however, one all-important added feature. The 'lizard' had feathers. The imprints of those feathers are unmistakable. They are in a double row down the length of the tail and are also present along the forelimbs.	
brocas-area	1861	Broca's area	Gall had speculated that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body. Now a postmortem of Broca's patient who lost the ability to speak revealed damage to an area in the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum.	Pierre-Paul Broca	France	phrenology	Science:Biology	Gall had been of the opinion that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body. Gall’s conclusions were strictly speculative. Broca, the first person to present conclusive evidence of a specific region of the brain in charge of a specific function, had a fifty-one-year-old patient who had lost the ability to speak. When the patient died in 1861, a postmortem revealed damage to the third convolution on the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum (now known as Broca’s convolution). Gall’s insight, which had been misdirected into phrenology, was thus put right.	
thallium	1861	Thallium	Thallium was discovered through spectroscopy, distinguishing itself with a bright green spectral line. This element, derived from heated selenium ores, was significant for its unique identifying characteristic via spectroscopy.	William Crookes	England	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Chemistry	Kirchhoff was not the only one to discover new elements by means of spectroscopy. The British physicist William Crookes was working with selenium ores, and in 1861 he came upon a sample of such ore that when heated showed a bright green line characteristic of no known element. He analyzed the ore in search of the new element, found it, and named it thallium, from the Greek word for 'green twig' after the color of its line.	
germ-theory-of-disease	1862	Germ theory of disease	Pasteur surveyed the evidence and synthesized it into a theory that contagious diseases are caused by microorganisms. It revolutionized medicine, leading to the prevention and treatment of diseases and significantly increasing life expectancy.	Louis Pasteur	France	pasteurization, cholera	Science:Biology	In 1862, Pasteur took up the matter and issued a publication that gathered all the evidence supporting that microorganisms cause diseases. This became a pivotal advancement in medicine, reducing the death rate, doubling life expectancy, and contributing to a significant population growth. The theory allowed scientists to identify specific microorganisms responsible for diseases and develop ways to prevent or cure them.	
dim-companion-of-sirius	1862	Dim companion of sirius	Using a newly ground 18-inch lens, Clark saw an anomaly near Sirius. The existence of a dark companion star orbiting Sirius was confirmed through its gravitational influence. This discovery added to the understanding of binary star systems.	Alvan Graham Clark	United States	companion-of-sirius	Space	Bessel had suggested the existence of a dark companion of Sirius, one that could not be seen but whose existence was indicated by its gravitational influence. On January 31, 1862, American astronomer Alvan Graham Clark confirmed this by observing the companion star through a telescope.	
hydrogen-in-the-sun	1862	Hydrogen in the sun	In later years, astronomers began to use spectral lines to compare the position of the dark lines to determine the solar spectrum. Ångström discovered hydrogen in the Sun, and later published a spectrum with wavelengths represented by each line in units of ten-billionths of a meter, now known as the ångström.	Anders Jonas Ångström	Sweden	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Physics	In 1862, the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Ångström announced his discovery of hydrogen in the Sun. He went on, in later years, to publish a map of the spectrum that showed the position of the dark lines in comparison to the solar spectrum, measured in units that are still known today as the ångström.	
chloroplasts	1862	Chloroplasts	Rather than being uniformly spread through plant cells, chlorophyll is concentrated in discrete bodies named chloroplasts. Starch grains appeared within chloroplasts, supporting the product of photosynthesis.	Julius von Sachs	Germany	chlorophyll-and-cells	Science:Biology	In 1862, the German botanist Julius von Sachs observed that plant cells contained discrete chlorophyll bodies, which he called chloroplasts. He noted that starch grains appeared within these chloroplasts, linking them directly to photosynthesis.	
source-of-the-white-nile	1862	Source of the white nile	Confirmed that the stream flowing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the White Nile. Speke traced the longest river flowing into Lake Victoria, the Luvironza, establishing it as the true source of the Nile, located in modern-day Burundi.	Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke	England	nile-river	Geography	In 1862, explorations led by Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke confirmed that a stream issuing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the White Nile. Speke traced the longest inflowing river, the Luvironza, establishing it as the true source of the Nile, located in modern-day Burundi.	
ironclad-warships	1862	Ironclad warships	The Confederate ironclad warship Merrimack (later renamed Virginia) attacked and sank wooden Union ships with ease due to its iron armor. The Union responded with its own ironclad, Monitor, and after a five-hour indecisive battle, it became clear that wooden warships were outdated, leading navies worldwide to adopt ironclads.	John Ericsson	United States	bessemer-steel, transatlantic-liner	War	The ironclad warship Merrimack (later renamed Virginia) attacked and sank wooden Union ships with ease due to its iron armor. The Union responded with its own ironclad, Monitor, and after a five-hour indecisive battle, it became clear that wooden warships were outdated, leading navies worldwide to adopt ironclads.	
machine-guns	1862	Machine guns	The Gatling gun, the first machine gun, was invented to shoot multiple bullets in rapid succession, building on repeating rifles called carbines which had come into use in 1860. It greatly increased the firepower available to armed forces, making it a significant development in military technology.	Richard Jordan Gatling	United States	revolvers	War	American inventor Richard Jordan Gatling created a rapid-fire gun that could shoot nearly six bullets per second using a rotating barrel mechanism. This invention, known as the Gatling gun, was used by Union forces during the Civil War and represented a major advancement in repeating firearms.	
hemoglobin	1862	Hemoglobin	The protein hemoglobin, crucial in carrying oxygen in the blood, was identified and named. This discovery was fundamental in understanding blood's role in oxygen transportation.	Felix Hoppe-Seyler	Germany	protein, oxygen	Science:Biology	German biochemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler crystallized the protein hemoglobin, which combines with oxygen in the lungs and transports it to tissues. He gave it the name hemoglobin (derived from the Greek word for blood, hemo, and globin, a protein class), and discovered that hemoglobin becomes oxyhemoglobin when it binds with oxygen.	
greenhouse-effect	1863	Greenhouse effect	The concept describes how gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in surface temperatures. This phenomenon is similar to how a greenhouse works.	John Tyndall	England	infrared-radiation	Science:Physics	In 1863, the Irish physicist John Tyndall pointed out that gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor are transparent to the visible light that reaches Earth's surface from the Sun, but rather opaque to the infrared radiations that the Earth gives off to space when it cools down at night. This means that the presence of even a small amount of these gases in the air will keep the Earth's surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be. This resembles the situation in a greenhouse, where light enters through the glass and warms the atmosphere within, but heat escapes only with difficulty, so that the net effect is to warm the greenhouse. For this reason, the action of carbon dioxide and water vapor is referred to as the greenhouse effect. Since human activity has somewhat increased the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and is continuing to do so, the greenhouse effect has become a serious threat.	
law-of-octaves	1863	Law of octaves	Now that over sixty elements were known, the proposed Law of Octaves grouped elements based on their atomic weights in a repeating pattern, resembling musical octaves. This failed attempt helped pave the way for better-organized periodic tables.	John Alexander Reina Newlands	England		Science:Chemistry	By this time, over sixty elements were known, and they seemed to represent an unruly jungle of characteristics. Chemists were uneasy with that, so they tried to group elements into families. Several attempts had already been made, but an English chemist tried something a bit different. He listed the elements in order of atomic weight and found that the second seven repeated the properties of the first seven quite closely. He tried to extend this further, referring to it as the law of octaves (as in music, where the same seven notes are repeated over and over, with every eighth note resembling the first octave higher, octave coming from the Latin word for “eight”). Newlands's work was not taken seriously because the list of elements fit the law of octaves very imperfectly. Nevertheless, it helped put the listing of elements in vogue, and in the course of the following decade, a much superior table was established.	
constitution-of-the-stars	1863	Constitution of the stars	Spectral analysis of stars revealed that their composition was similar to elements found on Earth, suggesting a commonality in the universe's materials. This discovery supported the idea that the universe comprises the same elements throughout.	William Huggins	England	spectral-lines-and-elements	Space	Granted that the elements in the Sun seemed to be the same as those on Earth, might it be argued that the Solar System would naturally be made of one set of materials but that other stars might be made of other elements? The English astronomer William Huggins studied the spectra of some of the brighter stars and announced in 1863 that their spectral lines were those of the old familiar elements. Presumably, then, the entire Universe was made up of the same elements.	
barbiturates	1863	Barbiturates	The discovery of barbituric acid led to the development of barbiturates, a class of compounds significant in the formulation of sleeping pills. This medicinal discovery has had a lasting impact on pharmacology.	Adolf von Baeyer	Germany	acid-base	Science:Pharmacology	In 1863 the German chemist Adolf von Baeyer discovered barbituric acid. Barbituric acid is the parent substance of a family of compounds known as barbiturates, which are well known today for their use in sleeping pills.	
indium	1863	Indium	Indium was discovered through spectroscopic analysis of a zinc ore precipitate, revealing a new element with unique indigo spectral lines. 	Ferdinand Reich and Theodor Richter	Germany	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Chemistry	A German mineralogist suspected that a yellow precipitate he had obtained from a zinc ore might contain a new metal. Because he himself was color-blind, he had his assistant examine it spectroscopically. Richer did so and spotted an indigo-colored line that was not characteristic of any known element. The new element was therefore named indium.	
nature-of-orion-nebula	1864	Nature of Orion Nebula	The Orion Nebula, previously thought to be a simple cloud of gas, was discovered to contain clusters of faint stars. This finding indicated that stars are embedded in nebulous regions and contribute to the nebula's luminosity.	William Huggins	England	clusters-and-nebulas	Space	Some patches of nebulosity, including the Milky Way itself, had turned out to be clusters of faint stars. A number of Messier objects had turned out to be globular clusters. The Orion nebula was studied, and it was found that its spectrum was typical of what would be expected of a luminous gas. It was concluded that the nebula is a large cloud of gas with stars embedded in it, which heat the gas to luminosity.	
genetics	1865	Genetics	Mendel discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance by conducting experiments with pea plants. He observed how plant height was passed from one generation to the next. Dominant traits would overpower recessive ones, but the recessive traits could reappear in future generations.	Gregor Johann Mendel	Austria	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science: Biology	Gregor Mendel, an Austrian botanist and monk, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance by conducting experiments with pea plants. He observed how certain traits, like plant height, were passed from one generation to the next. By carefully arranging plants to self-pollinate and analyzing the traits in their offspring, Mendel concluded that organisms have pairs of factors for each trait that segregate during reproduction. Dominant traits would overpower recessive ones, but the recessive traits could reappear in future generations. His work laid the groundwork for the science of genetics.	
benzene-ring	1865	Benzene ring	The benzene ring is a molecular structure consisting of six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring with hydrogen atoms attached. This configuration made benzene stable and significantly contributed to the understanding of molecular structures.	August Kekulé	Germany	organic-molecular-structure	Science:Chemistry	The molecule of benzene is made up of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. Given a chain of six carbon atoms, there seemed to be no way of adding six hydrogen atoms without producing a very unstable compound—and benzene was quite stable. It was Kekulé himself who found the answer in 1865. According to his own story, he was in a semidoze in a horse-drawn bus and was visualizing carbon chains when suddenly the tail end of one chain attached itself to the head end and formed a spinning ring. At once he saw that if he imagined the six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon, a stable atom might be the result. Once the notion of carbon rings was added to that of carbon chains, many structural problems were solved.	
avogadros-number	1865	Avogadro’s number	Avogadro’s number represents the number of molecules in 22.4 liters of any gas, which is approximately 6×10^23. This measurement allowed scientists to quantify the number of atoms and molecules in a given volume and weigh gases accurately.	Johann Joseph Loschmidt	England	kinetic-theory-of-gases, avogadro-revived	Science:Chemistry	The hydrogen molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atom has an atomic weight of just about 1, so that a hydrogen molecule has a molecular weight of 2. Hydrogen gas is made up of hydrogen molecules, and at 0°C and normal atmospheric pressure at sea level, 22.4 liters (5.9 gallons) of hydrogen gas weigh 2 grams. This is the molecular weight in grams, or 1 mole. Since equal volumes of gases are made up of equal numbers of molecules, according to Avogadro’s hypothesis (see 1811), and since each oxygen molecule has a weight of 32, then 22.4 liters of oxygen gas would weigh 32 grams—or 1 mole. In fact, 22.4 liters of any gas are likely to weigh 1 mole. The question is, how many molecules are there in 22.4 liters of a gas? In 1865 the Austrian chemist Johann Joseph Loschmidt used Maxwell’s kinetic theory of gases (see 1859) to calculate what that number ought to be. It turned out to be about 600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or six hundred billion trillion. Since all this was based on Avogadro’s hypothesis, the number was called Avogadro’s number. From Avogadro’s number, you could calculate the actual mass of a hydrogen molecule, since it would be 2 grams divided by six hundred billion trillion. A hydrogen atom would have a mass half that, and the mass of other atoms and molecules could be calculated as well. For the first time, scientists had a notion, and a rather good one, as it turned out, of the mass of the tiny atoms and molecules that make up matter.	
antiseptic-surgery	1865	Antiseptic surgery	Lister introduced the use of phenol solutions to clean hands and instruments during surgeries, which significantly reduced post-operative infections. This advancement drastically reduced the mortality rates and complications associated with surgeries.	Joseph Lister	England	anesthesia, germ-theory-of-disease, puerperal-fever	Science:Medicine	Anesthetics had come into use nearly twenty years before, but if the process had become more...	
maxwells-equations	1865	Maxwell’s equations	Maxwell devised a set of equations that unified electricity and magnetism into a single electromagnetic force. These equations demonstrated the relationship between electric oscillations and electromagnetic fields, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	laws-motion	Science:Physics	The culminating work of Maxwell came when he began to devise a set of equations, simple in form, that expressed all the varied phenomena of electricity and magnetism and bound them together indissolubly, as Newton had done for gravitation. Maxwell showed that electricity and magnetism did not exist separately, but that each was an inevitable aspect of the other. There was a single electromagnetic force. Maxwell showed that the oscillation of an electric charge produced an electromagnetic field that radiated outward from its source at a constant speed. This speed could be calculated from the equations and turned out to be just the speed of light.	
mobius-strip	1865	Möbius strip	The Möbius strip is a one-sided surface that challenges traditional geometry, created by twisting a strip of paper 180 degrees and joining its ends. This concept found applications in various scientific and artistic fields, demonstrating properties of non-orientable surfaces and founding topology.	August Ferdinand Möbius	Germany	analytic-geometry	Math:Topology	In 1865, the German mathematician August Ferdinand Möbius presented what came to be called a Möbius strip. This is a long, flat strip of paper (or other flexible material) that is given a half twist and the two ends then pasted together to give a circular figure with one edge and one side. The resulting construction has only one surface and one edge. This made Möbius one of the founders of topology, the branch of mathematics that deals with properties of figures that are not altered by deformations (as long as there is no tearing).	
cylinder-locks	1865	Cylinder locks	Cylinder locks feature a key with a serrated edge that aligns spring-loaded pins within the lock cylinder to allow entry. This innovation significantly increased security for locks by making them difficult to pick and easy to mass-produce with unique key combinations.	Linus Yale	United States		Design	In 1865, an American locksmith patented a cylinder lock with tumblers that had to be brought into a certain alignment for the lock to open. The key had a serrated edge that sufficed to bring the tumblers into line. A vast number of combinations were possible, so that every key could be unique, even if there were millions of locks. The familiar locks and keys that have controlled house and apartment doors ever since are based on this principle.	
dynamite	1866	Dynamite	Dynamite is a powerful explosive material composed by safely combining nitroglycerine with kieselguhr. It allowed safe, controlled explosions for construction and mining, revolutionizing those industries.	Alfred Bernard Nobel	Sweden	nitroglycerine	Science: Chemistry	During the twenty years since nitroglycerine had been discovered, it had been used in blasting roads through mountains, digging canals, and laying foundations. However, it was highly unstable, and frequently caused accidental explosions. Swedish inventor Alfred Bernard Nobel developed a safer way of using nitroglycerine by combining it with kieselguhr, a substance that absorbed the liquid nitroglycerine without detonating. This combination, called dynamite, could be handled safely until an external detonator was used, making it ideal for controlled explosions in construction and mining. This invention significantly improved safety in these industries and led to the establishment of the annual Nobel prizes funded by Nobel's estate.	
clinical-thermometer	1866	Clinical thermometer	The clinical thermometer is a medical instrument designed to accurately measure a patient's body temperature. It made temperature measurement more convenient and reliable in clinical settings.	Thomas Clifford Allbutt	England	mercury-thermometer	Science: Medicine	Doctors had long recognized the importance of knowing a patient’s temperature, but existing thermometers were cumbersome, imprecise, and slow, often requiring up to 20 minutes to register results. British physician Thomas Clifford Allbutt developed a small thermometer that could be easily used to measure body temperature more quickly and accurately. This invention greatly improved clinical diagnostics and patient care, allowing for more efficient and precise monitoring of patient health.	
kirkwood-gaps	1866	Kirkwood gaps	The discovery of the Kirkwood gaps revealed that the distribution of asteroids in the asteroid belt is not uniform. These gaps occur due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter, which causes asteroids to be either pulled away or pushed into these gaps.	Daniel Kirkwood	United States	asteroids	Space	By now, nearly ninety asteroids had been discovered and their orbits calculated. It was clear that they were not evenly distributed, and the American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood showed in 1866 that there were definite gaps, since called 'Kirkwood gaps.' He explained these gaps by postulating that any asteroids that would have been in those gaps would revolve around the Sun in a period that had a simple ratio to the period of Jupiter. That meant that every two or three turns of the asteroid would bring it into the same position with respect to Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational pull would then be cumulative, and the asteroid would be forced either farther from the Sun or nearer to it, leaving a gap.	
earths-iron-core	1866	Earth's iron core	The hypothesis that Earth's center must be composed of denser material than its crust was confirmed through the study of meteorites. This led to the acceptance that Earth has a nickel-iron core, shaping our understanding of the planet's composition.	Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée	France	mass-of-the-earth, meteorites	Science:Geology	Ever since Cavendish had determined the Earth's mass (see 1798), it had been known that the Earth's average density was about twice that of its rocky crust. The conclusion was that Earth's center must be made of material that was denser than rock. Metal seemed to be the only reasonable alternative. The French geologist Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée, considering the fact that a number of meteorites were composed of a nickel-iron alloy (though most were rocky), assumed that if meteorites were remnants of an exploded planet, the rocky ones came from the outermost portions of the planet, and the nickel-iron ones came from its core. He reasoned that this would be true of Earth as well, so that Earth had a nickel-iron core. This has been accepted by geologists ever since.	
composition-of-a-nova	1866	Composition of a nova	The study of nova spectra revealed that they are dominated by hydrogen, indicating its presence as a major component of the Universe. This finding was pivotal in understanding the composition and behavior of novas.	William Huggins	England	supernova, reflecting-telescope	Space	Since the exceedingly bright novas spied by Tycho Brahe and by Kepler nearly three centuries before, further novas of the sort had been seen. Nevertheless, dim novas had been sighted, and they still attracted notice because they had brightened suddenly and without warning. In 1866 Huggins managed to study the spectrum of a nova and showed from its spectral lines that it was surrounded by a cloud of hydrogen. This was the first indication that hydrogen might be a dominating constituent of the Universe.	
dry-cell	1867	Dry cell	Up to now, all batteries were made of liquids inside a container, which was not safe. The dry cell battery was invented, which converted battery fluid into a non-spillable paste. This innovation made batteries safer and more practical for everyday use.	Georges Leclanché	France	storage-battery	Science:Chemistry	Batteries before this consisted of liquid-filled containers that required careful handling. In 1867, Georges Leclanché created a cell that converted the liquid into a stiff paste, making it much safer and easier to use. The resulting dry cells enabled the widespread use of batteries in various small devices, from flashlights to toys.	
typewriters	1867	Typewriters	The first typewriter that could be used to write as quickly as hand writing was invented, streamlining the process of document creation. This invention marked a significant advancement in writing technology.	Christopher Latham Sholes	United States	printing-press	Design:Technology	Printing had existed for centuries but writing letters or stories still had to be done by hand. Attempts to create machines for this purpose existed, but they were cumbersome and slow. In 1867, Christopher Latham Sholes invented the first reasonably compact and practical writing machine, which could produce documents more quickly than manual handwriting.	
law-of-mass-action	1867	Law of mass action	The law of mass action describes how chemical reactions can be reversed by varying the mass of the reactants. This principle has been fundamental in advancing the field of thermodynamics and chemical reaction engineering.	Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage	Norway	thermochemistry	Science:Chemistry	Chemists discovered that chemical reactions could often proceed in two directions, and by increasing the mass of one set of reactants, the reaction could be forced to move in the direction that consumed that set. Norwegian chemists Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage demonstrated that it's not mass alone but concentration—the quantity of mass in a given volume—that determines reaction direction. Known as the law of mass action, it was promulgated in 1867 and laid the foundation for modern thermodynamics and its application to chemical reactions.	
air-brake	1868	Air brake	The air brake uses compressed air to simultaneously stop every wheel on a train, greatly improving rail safety. This invention overcame the difficulty of manually stopping trains, which involved significant risks of collisions and accidents.	George Westinghouse	United States	steam-locomotive-improved	Design: Engineering	In 1868 the American engineer George Westinghouse invented the air brake, which used compressed air rather than human muscle. Such an air brake could be applied simultaneously to every wheel on the train. Cornelius Vanderbilt dismissed the idea as a 'fool notion' because he did not believe that one could stop a train by the use of air. However, the air brake, after some improvements, caught on quickly and greatly increased rail safety.	
helium	1868	Helium	Thanks to modern transportation, astronomers could take a journey to see an eclipse if they liked. Studying an eclipse in India, Janssen discovered a new spectral line corresponding to a new element, Helium.	Pierre-Jules-César Janssen	France	spectral-lines-and-elements, transatlantic-liner	Space	Improvements in transportation had made it possible for astronomers to travel all over the world if they had to. The most spectacular astronomical phenomenon that might be confined to a small area almost anywhere in the world was a total eclipse of the Sun. When an eclipse was due to be visible at certain areas in India in 1868, European astronomers didn’t hesitate to make the journey. A French astronomer at the site, Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, studied the spectra of the solar prominences. Meanwhile, a British astronomer, Joseph Norman Lockyer, showed that by allowing light from the edge of the Sun to pass through a prism, he could obtain spectra of prominences even without an eclipse. Janssen observed a spectral line that did not match any of the known lines in position. He sent a report on this to Lockyer, who decided that the line represented a hitherto unknown element. The element was named helium, from the Greek word for 'sun.'	
cro-magnon-man	1868	Cro-magnon man	The discovery of Cro-Magnon man in a cave revealed that these humans were around thirty-five thousand years old, indicating an early form of modern humans. This finding challenged the belief that the human race was far younger and shed light on human evolution.	Édouard-Armand-Isidore-Hippolyte Lartet	France	neanderthal-man	Science:Archaeology	In 1868, a French paleontologist discovered four skeletons of human beings in a cave called Cro-Magnon. They were around thirty-five thousand years old but human in every respect, demonstrating that this earlier form of human was significantly older than previously thought.	
deep-sea-life	1868	Deep-sea life	The discovery of deep-sea life revealed that living organisms could thrive in depths far lower than light could reach. This groundbreaking finding expanded our understanding of marine biology and the adaptability of life forms.	Charles Wyville Thomson	England	telegraph-plateau	Science:Biology	In 1868, a British zoologist began deep-sea dredging operations, leading to the identification of life forms thriving in the depths of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans. This research showed that life exists from the ocean's surface to its depths, even though deep-sea life does not live in the same profusion as surface life.	
periodic-table-of-the-elements	1869	Periodic table of the elements	Arranging elements in order of increasing atomic weight, Mendeleev allowed the length of periods to vary according to the properties of elements, creating a table that predicted undiscovered elements. His periodic table became the foundation for modern chemistry, providing a systematic way to understand element properties and interactions.	Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev	Russia	law-of-octaves	Science:Chemistry	In Mendeleev's original periodic table of 1871, the periods were listed vertically and groups horizontally, with elements arranged by increasing atomic weight. He predicted the existence and properties of then-undiscovered elements by leaving gaps, some of which were later filled by actual discoveries such as eka-silicon (germanium). This new organization allowed for periodic trends and valences to be more apparent, leading to a comprehensive understanding of chemical properties and behaviors.	
nucleic-acid	1869	Nucleic acid	A substance was isolated from cell remnants that did not belong to the known classes of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. This substance was later identified as nucleic acid and contained nitrogen and phosphorus.	Johann Friedrich Miescher	Switzerland	food-classification	Science:Biology	The classification of foodstuffs into carbohydrates, fats, and proteins was satisfactory until 1869. In that year, a Swiss biochemist isolated a substance in cell nuclei, named 'nuclein', that contained nitrogen and phosphorus and did not belong to any known classes of foodstuffs. The true importance of nuclein, later known as nucleic acid, was appreciated when it was revealed as essential to the cell's functions.	
critical-temperature	1869	Critical temperature	An Irish physical chemist determined the specific temperature above which gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. This concept became essential for chemists working with permanent gases.	Thomas Andrews	Ireland	permanent-gases	Science:Physics	An Irish physical chemist studied the liquefaction of gases, particularly carbon dioxide. He discovered that as the temperature rose, more pressure was needed to liquefy it until it reached a critical temperature at which only lower temperatures could enable liquefaction. This critical temperature was crucial for chemists dealing with so-called permanent gases.	
biogeography	1869	Biogeography	A naturalist developed the concept separating animal species of Australia and Asia, marking a distinct ecological divide that laid the foundations of biogeography. "Wallace's line" drew a clear separation between the evolutionary paths of species on the two continents.	Alfred Russel Wallace	England	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science:Geography	A naturalist noticed significant differences between the animal species of Australia and Asia, leading him to delineate a boundary, known as Wallace's line, which separates these two distinct groups. This realization laid the groundwork for the science of biogeography, which explores the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time.	
islets-of-langerhans	1869	Islets of langerhans	A German physician identified clusters of cells within the pancreas that produce hormones essential for regulating blood sugar levels. These clusters were named the Islets of Langerhans after their discoverer.	Paul Langerhans	Germany	diabetes	Science:Biology	A German physician, while studying the microscopic structure of the pancreas, identified numerous small, distinct clusters of cells. These cell clusters, later named Islets of Langerhans, were found to play a crucial role in producing hormones that regulate blood sugar levels, significantly advancing the understanding of endocrine pancreas function.	
celluloid	1869	Celluloid	Celluloid is the first commercially successful plastic, made from pyroxylin and used for various materials like baby rattles, shirt collars, and photographic film. Its light, flexible, and waterproof properties greatly impacted the manufacturing of household items despite its flammability.	John Wesley Hyatt	United States	pyroxylin	Science: Chemistry	Celluloid is a type of plastic material originally made from pyroxylin. It was invented to find a cheaper alternative to ivory for billiard balls. Although it did not win the prize for this purpose, it found practical applications in various products due to its light, flexible, waterproof, and easy-to-clean properties. However, its flammable nature was a significant drawback. Regardless, it marked the advent of commercially viable plastics.	
stock-ticker	1869	Stock ticker	The stock ticker, a telegraph machine for transmitting gold prices, revolutionized financial communication by providing real-time stock market information. It played a significant role in the efficiency and effectiveness of financial trading.	Thomas Alva Edison	United States	telegraph	Design	The stock ticker was invented by Thomas Alva Edison after observing the inefficient methods in a broker's office. This telegraph machine transmitted gold prices and other stock information, allowing investors to receive timely updates. The invention of the stock ticker dramatically improved the speed and reliability of financial transactions, making a lasting impact on Wall Street and the financial industry.	
troy	1870	Troy	Discovery of multiple ancient sites of immense historical interest in present-day Turkey. Heinrich Schliemann used Homer's Iliad to locate the remains and various artifacts, notably contributing to archaeological research.	Heinrich Schliemann	Germany	literature	Science:Archaeology	The ancient non-Biblical site of most interest to Europeans was surely Troy, in what is now the northwestern part of Asian Turkey. It was there that the semilegendary Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C., and many who had read Homer's Iliad in the last twenty-five centuries had thought there was a historical basis to it. One of the believers was a German businessman, Heinrich Schliemann, who worked hard to make a fortune, for the sole purpose of using it to locate the ruined city of Troy. In 1870 he went to Turkey, managed to choose the right spot (following the description in the Iliad), and uncovered a series of ancient cities, built one on top of the other. He obtained various fascinating artifacts, many of them made of gold. Although Schliemann was not the first archaeologist, and was a very unscientific one, ruining a great deal more than he found, his findings were sensational and rang through the world. His work was a great stimulant to archaeological research in general.	
human-evolution	1871	Human evolution	Darwin published "Descent of Man" discussing the principles of evolution as it specifically applies to humans. The publication emphasizes the role of biological evolution in shaping human life and identifies vestigial organs as evidence for evolution.	Charles Darwin	England	evolution-by-natural-selection, cro-magnon-man	Science:Biology	Darwin, writing his book on evolution, had initially refrained from discussing human evolution to avoid controversy. In 1871, he published *The Descent of Man,* which applied the principles of evolution to humanity, highlighting the significance of biological evolution in human development. He pointed out vestigial organs in humans as evidence for evolution from nonhuman animals.	
dry-plates	1871	Dry plates	A development in photography that allowed the use of dry solutions instead of collodion, making it easier and faster to produce photographs. This innovation increased the sensitivity and ease of use in photographic processes.	Joseph Wilson Swan	England	photography	Design:Photography	Until this invention, photography relied on solutions smeared on plates or films, which were difficult to handle. Swan found that heating these solutions increased their sensitivity and drying them made the results more consistent. The use of dry plates revolutionized photography by reducing exposure times and simplifying the photographic process.	
plant-strains	1871	Plant strains	The cultivation and development of new plant strains that demonstrated the variation within species and supported the theory of evolution through natural selection. This work highlighted the potential for creating new varieties of plants through careful selection and breeding.	Luther Burbank	United States	evolution-by-natural-selection, genetics	Science:Botany	Luther Burbank began his extensive work on cultivating new plant strains. He specialized in producing new fruit strains and developed sixty varieties of plums among other plants. His work provided clear examples of the capacity for variation within organisms and supported Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.	
gilgamesh	1872	Gilgamesh found	The epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest literary work, was uncovered and it contained a flood story similar to the Biblical tales. This discovery further increased popular interest in archaeology.	George Smith	England	literature, cuneiform-decipherment	Culture	The last great king of the Assyrian Empire, Ashurbanipal, had patronized art and literature and established a large library in Nineveh. In the 1860s, British archaeologists excavated the site of ruined Nineveh and brought cuneiform tablets back to the British Museum. George Smith, an expert at reading cuneiform, discovered the epic of Gilgamesh in 1872 and announced it contained a flood story used by Biblical writers. This created a large sensation and increased popular interest in archaeology.	
bacteriology	1872	Bacteriology	Bacteriology, the study of bacteria, became prominent when it was discovered that numerous bacteria were pathogenic. They are also extremely resilient, capable of surviving desiccation and boiling. This field of study advanced the understanding of diseases and their contagious nature.	Ferdinand Julius Cohn	Germany	germ-theory-of-disease	Science:Biology	Bacteria, known for two centuries, were not studied in detail until Pasteur's germ theory of disease in 1862. A German botanist, inspired by Pasteur's work, was the first to treat bacteriology as a special branch of knowledge in 1872. It was discovered that some bacteria were pathogenic, causing certain diseases and their contagious character.	
stellar-photography	1872	Stellar photography	This involves photographing a star’s spectrum to study light sources. It eventually allowed astronomers to photograph the spectra of over a hundred stars.	Henry Draper	United States	dry-plates	Space	The American astronomer Henry Draper was the first to photograph a star’s spectrum (that of Vega). As Draper adopted the use of dry plates, stellar photography became easier, facilitating the capture of the spectra of numerous stars.	
experimental-psychology	1872	Experimental psychology	Experimental psychology was initiated to measure facets of human behavior using scientific methods. It includes the establishment of laboratories and journals for publishing behavioral findings.	Wilhelm Wundt	Germany		Science:Psychology	Wilhelm Wundt suggested that aspects of human behavior could be measured profitably. He wrote a textbook on the subject and later established the first laboratory and journal dedicated to experimental psychology.	
gas-laws	1873	Gas laws	van der Waals showed that gases follow certain laws relating volume, pressure, and temperature only if the molecules have a small volume and a small attraction between them. His demonstration refined the earlier understanding established by Boyle and others.	Johannes Diderik van der Waals	Netherlands	boyles-law	Science:Chemistry	Johannes Diderik van der Waals showed that gases follow certain laws relating volume, pressure, and temperature only if the molecules have a small volume and a small attraction between them. His demonstration refined the earlier understanding established by Boyle and others.	
leprosy	1873	Leprosy	A bacterium was discovered as the cause of leprosy, which led to the disease being named Hansen's disease. This marked the first discovery of a microorganism causing a specific disease, providing a breakthrough in medical microbiology.	Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen	Norway	bacteriology	Science:Biology	In 1873, a Norwegian physician discovered that a specific bacterium was the cause of leprosy, and as a result, it became known as Hansen's disease. This pivotal discovery marked the first occasion where a specific microorganism was identified as causing a particular disease, significantly advancing the field of medical microbiology and the understanding of infectious diseases.	
transcendental-e	1873	Transcendental e	Hermite proved that e (a very important mathematical constant ~ 2.71828) is a transcendental number. Transcendental numbers cannot be solutions to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients.	Charles Hermite	France	transcendental-numbers	Math	In 1873, a French mathematician succeeded in proving that e (a very important mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828) is a transcendental number. This significant discovery involved proving that certain numbers, called transcendental numbers, cannot be solutions to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients, thus expanding the knowledge of irrational numbers in mathematics.	
platelets	1873	Platelets	Platelets, also called thrombocytes, were identified and studied, revealing their role in blood clotting. This discovery marked a crucial advancement in hematology and understanding of blood components.	William Osler	Canada	red-blood-cells	Science:Medicine	In 1873, a Canadian physician studied platelets (small cells in the blood) which are fewer in number than red and white blood cells, but play a crucial role in blood clotting. These cells, called thrombocytes, were extensively studied for their shape and function, leading to important discoveries about their role in the clotting process and significance in medical hematology.	
gallium	1874	Gallium	A new element named gallium was discovered, displaying unique spectral lines and validating predictions made in the periodic table. This discovery firmly established Mendeleyev’s table, confirming it for subsequent scientific exploration.	Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran	France	periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science:Chemistry	The discovery of new elements continued after Mendeleyev announced his periodic table of elements. In 1874, the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran found a zinc ore that displayed previously unknown spectral lines. He extracted the new element and named it gallium, from the old Latin word for the area that later became France after the fall of the Roman Empire. Mendeleyev had predicted this element as eka-aluminium, and gallium's characteristics and properties aligned with his prediction, solidifying the validity of the periodic table.	
tetrahedral-carbon-atom	1874	Tetrahedral carbon atom	A new three-dimensional representation of organic molecules demonstrated that molecules must be asymmetric to rotate polarized light, showing that the four valence bonds of the carbon atom pointed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron. 	Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff	Netherlands	organic-molecular-structure, geometry	Science:Chemistry	Kekule's earlier two-dimensional models of organic molecules had limitations, as some molecules in solution rotated the plane of polarized light, implying necessary asymmetry. In 1874, Dutch physical chemist Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff advanced this understanding by creating a three-dimensional model. He showed that the four valence bonds of the carbon atom pointed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron, with one bond pointing upward and three arranged equally below, illustrating the essential structural asymmetry of organic molecules in achieving specific chemical behaviors.	
transfinite-numbers	1874	Transfinite numbers	The invention of transfinite numbers illustrates an endless series of numbers larger than the ordinary infinity of integers. This concept revolutionized mathematical understanding of infinity and real numbers.	Ludwig Philipp Cantor	Germany		Math	The German mathematician Ludwig Philipp Cantor introduced the concept of transfinite numbers, addressing the troublesome notion of infinity. He demonstrated that while all fractions (rational numbers) are countable through one-to-one correspondence, real numbers (rational and irrational) are not, representing a higher form of infinity. This mathematical innovation showed that real numbers exist in an endlessly larger quantity, changing our approach to infinity and counting.	
current-and-crystals	1874	Current and crystals	It was discovered that in some crystals, electric current can pass through in one direction but not the other. This finding later led to significant advancements in electronics and technology.	Karl Ferdinand Braun	Germany	electrical-conductance, crystallography	Science: Physics	German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun observed in 1874 that some crystals allowed electric current to pass through in one direction but not the other. At the time, the full implications and reasons were not clear, but this curious observation paved the way for later technological advancements, particularly in the development of diodes and semiconductor technology.	
fertilization-observed	1875	Fertilization	Fertilization was observed when a sperm cell entered an egg cell of a sea urchin, confirming that a union of both was necessary for the birth of young. This observation greatly advanced the understanding of reproductive biology.	Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig	Germany	fertilization	Science:Biology	Egg cells and sperm cells were both known, and it was clear that the birth of young required a union of the two. Nevertheless, such a union was not observed until the German embryologist Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig saw a sperm cell actually enter the egg cell of a sea urchin. What's more, although sperm cells are produced in swarming plenty, Hertwig could see that but a single sperm cell entered the egg cell and that it sufficed for fertilization.	
radiometer	1875	Radiometer	The radiometer was created to demonstrate the effects of solar radiation by using pivoted vanes (one side blackened, the other shiny) in a vacuum that turned when exposed to sunlight. It provided vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.	William Crookes	England	geissler-tubes, kinetic-theory-of-gases	Science:Physics	In 1875 Crookes devised the radiometer, consisting of a set of pivoted vanes in a vacuum. One side of each vane was blackened so that it would absorb heat, and the other side was shiny so that it would reflect it. In the presence of sunlight, the vanes turned steadily. This was not due to solar radiation, for if the container was evacuated particularly well, the motion ceased. Actually, the air molecules in the imperfect vacuum rebounded from the heated side more strongly than from the cooler, shiny side, thus 'kicking' it around. This required a partial vacuum to work, as otherwise air resistance would muffle the motion. The radiometer was only a toy, but it offered vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.	
telephone	1876	Telephone	The telephone was invented to transmit spoken words over wires by converting sound waves into electric currents. This allowed sound to be sent and received over long distances, revolutionizing communication.	Alexander Graham Bell	United States	telegraph	Science:Technology	The telegraph, now over thirty years old, transmitted only signals. The British-born American inventor Alexander Graham Bell wanted something better than that. He wanted to send actual speech over the wires, by turning sound waves into a fluctuating electric current that waxed and waned as the sound waves compressed and decompressed air. The electric current could then be reconverted into sound at the other end. He finally invented a device capable of doing that and first made use of it accidentally. He had spilled battery acid on his pants.	
four-stroke-engine	1876	Four-stroke engine	The four-stroke engine involves the piston making four strokes—intake, compression, power, and exhaust—which improved the efficiency of internal combustion engines. This invention had a significant impact on the development of automobiles and various machinery.	Nikolaus August Otto	Germany	internal-combustion-engine	Science:Engineering	The Lenoir internal-combustion engine had been developed sixteen years earlier, but its inefficiency was recognized. A German engineer, Nikolaus August Otto, built a version in which the piston made four strokes—intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This cycle allowed for more efficient fuel burning and energy conversion, paving the way for the modern internal combustion engine used in cars and other machinery.	
chemical-thermodynamics	1876	Chemical thermodynamics	Thermodynamics principles were applied to chemical reactions, evolving the modern concepts of energy and chemical potential. He also explored equilibria involving different phases and the number of ways temperature, pressure, or concentration interrelate. This application helped in understanding equilibria and the phase rule, influencing various scientific fields.	Josiah Willard Gibbs	United States	second-law-of-thermodynamics	Science: Chemistry	Thermodynamics, initially developed through the study of heat, was applied to chemical changes. In a series of papers, an American physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs, discussed how energy and chemical potential drive chemical reactions. He also explored equilibria involving different phases and the number of ways temperature, pressure, or concentration can vary, which can be expressed by the phase rule. This work significantly contributed to the field of chemical thermodynamics.	
bacterial-cultivation	1876	Bacterial cultivation	The bacteria causing anthrax was identified, isolated, and grown outside a living body, finding a practical application for Pasteur's germ theory. He later learned to grow bacteria inside gelatin or agar. This advancement allowed for better understanding and control of infectious diseases.	Robert Koch	Germany	germ-theory-of-disease	Science: Biology	During an anthrax epidemic in eastern Germany, physician Robert Koch identified the bacterium causing the disease. He successfully isolated and cultivated the bacteria outside living organisms using blood serum at body temperature and later solid media like gelatin and agar. These methods allowed him to prove that a particular strain of bacteria was responsible for the disease, providing a concrete application of germ theory and aiding in the research for disease prevention and cures.	
cathode-rays	1876	Cathode rays	Cathode rays were defined as streams of radiation traveling from the negatively charged electrode in a vacuum tube. This discovery paved the way for further research in electron physics and the development of electronic devices.	Eugen Goldstein	Germany	electricity-in-a-vacuum, lightning-rod	Science: Physics	German physicist Eugen Goldstein investigated the passage of electric currents through a vacuum and observed fluorescence near the cathode, indicating radiation known as cathode rays. This phenomenon showed that these rays consisted of negatively charged particles, contributing to the early understanding of electron behavior and influencing subsequent experiments in the field of electron physics.	
protein-size	1877	Protein size	Explained how certain substances could pass through membranes while others could not and presented the concept of osmotic pressure. This work laid the foundation for calculating molecular weights of proteins and understanding macromolecules.	Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer	Germany	osmosis	Science:Biology	The fact of osmosis—that some substances could go through certain membranes while others could not—had been known for two decades. In 1877 a German botanist Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer (1845–1920), explained the phenomenon by showing that large molecules would not go through, while small ones would. If all the large molecules were on one side of the membrane, they would block the passage of some of the small ones. That meant that more small molecules would pass through from the side that lacked the large molecules. The side with the large molecules would then swell, as more small molecules entered than left, and it would experience an osmotic pressure. Pfeffer showed how one might measure this osmotic pressure and related that pressure to the size of the molecules that could not pass through the membrane. If a particular protein was on one side of the membrane, then from the osmotic pressure developed on that side Pfeffer could calculate the molecular weight of the protein. Pfeffer was also the first to determine the molecular weights of proteins and to show that they were macromolecules made up of hundreds, even thousands, of atoms.	
liquid-oxygen	1877	Liquid oxygen	Progress in the liquefaction of gases led to cooling oxygen and other gases to extreme temperatures, creating liquid oxygen. This discovery enabled advancements in physics and chemistry related to gas properties and behaviors.	Louis-Paul Cailletet and Raoul-Pierre Pictet	France	critical-temperature, gas-laws, liquefying-gases	Science:Chemistry	The work of Andrews (see 1869) and of van der Waals (see 1873) had emphasized the fact that gases that resisted liquefaction had to be cooled as far as possible before pressure could be usefully applied, or the Joule-Thomson cooling-by-expansion effect attempted. In 1877 a French physicist, Louis-Paul Cailletet (1832–1913), cooled oxygen intensively and then let it expand. He got a fog of liquid droplets of oxygen. By using similar techniques, he also managed to get small quantities of liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon monoxide as well. A Swiss chemist, Raoul-Pierre Pictet (1846–1929), managed to do this independently in the same year. Using a more elaborate method, he produced greater quantities of the liquids. As it turned out, oxygen liquefied at −183° C (90° K); carbon monoxide at −191° C (82° K); and nitrogen at −196° C (77° K). The only known gas that remained a gas at the temperature that sufficed to liquefy nitrogen was hydrogen. (Two other gases, as yet unknown, would also have remained unliquefiable at this time.)	
phonograph	1877	Phonograph	The phonograph is a device that records and reproduces sound. It significantly contributed to the music industry by enabling the mechanical recording and playback of sound.	Thomas Edison	United States	telephone	General	In 1876 Edison had opened the first industrial research laboratory, at Menlo Park, New Jersey. In 1877, he improved the telephone mouthpiece in a crucial manner and invented the phonograph. He put tinfoil on a cylinder, set a free-floating needle skimming over it as the cylinder turned, and connected a source that would carry sound waves to the needle. The needle then impressed a track on the tinfoil, which could later reproduce the sound. This invention led to the eventual creation of various music playback technologies.	
martian-canals	1877	Martian canals	Martian canals were perceived networks of linear markings on Mars that were thought to be channels filled with water and built by intelligent beings. This lead to significant speculation about advanced Martian civilizations.	Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli	Italy	martian-ice-caps	Space	Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed Mars during a close approach to Earth in 1877. He saw markings that he interpreted as water channels and named them 'canali', which was mistranslated to 'canals' in English. This led to the widespread belief that these were constructed by intelligent Martian beings to carry water from polar ice caps to the equatorial regions of Mars.	
martian-satellites	1877	Martian moons	Two small Martian satellites were discovered and named Phobos and Deimos after the sons of Ares. This contributed to the understanding of planetary systems and the natural satellites of other planets.	Asaph Hall	United States	jupiter-moons, ariel-and-umbriel	Space	In 1877, during a conjunction of Earth and Mars, American astronomer Asaph Hall seized the opportunity to confirm if Mars had any natural satellites. Using improved telescopes, Hall discovered two small satellites, later named Phobos and Deimos. These satellites helped deepen the understanding of Mars and its celestial system while debunking previous assumptions that Mars did not have any satellites.	
enzyme	1878	Enzyme	Previously, living catalysts were called ferments. Kuhne suggested that non-living substances that act as biological catalysts be called enzymes. Eventually the name enzyme came to be applied to living and non-living biological catalysts.	Wilhelm Friedrich Kühne	Germany	catalysis	Science:Biology	In 1878, Wilhelm Friedrich Kühne proposed that substances exerting catalytic effects in biological systems should be called enzymes, derived from the Greek meaning 'in yeast.' This shifted the perception from considering these catalysts as alive to recognizing their universal role in biological reactions, irrespective of their existence in living or isolated forms.	
varves	1878	Varves	Layered sediments in glacial-fed lakes were studied by counting the varves (Swedish for "layers") and estimating a glacier's age in (12,000 years) with considerable accuracy. This discovery was pivotal in identifying seasonal patterns in sediment deposition and their correlation with glacial and interglacial periods.	Gerard Jakob de Geer	Sweden	ice-age	Science:Geology	A Swedish geologist, Gerard Jakob de Geer, conducted studies in 1878 on finest and coarser sediment layers in glacier-fed lakes. His work showed that these layers alternated seasonally, revealing significant insights into the duration and intervals of ice ages and interglacial periods.	
ytterbium	1878	Ytterbium	Discovery of ytterbium added to the list of elements isolated from rare earths. This contribution expanded the known elements, aiding further chemical research and application.	Jean-Charles-Galissard de Marignac	Switzerland	rare-earths	Science:Chemistry	Six elements had been isolated from rare earths, but in 1878, the discovery of ytterbium by Jean-Charles-Galissard de Marignac added another element to this list. Named after the Ytterby quarry where the first rare earth was discovered, ytterbium's discovery helped enhance the understanding and utilization of rare earth elements in various fields.	
electric-light	1879	Electric light	Electric light involves using a wire filament heated to incandescence in a vacuum-sealed bulb, which provides safer and more reliable lighting compared to previous methods. This invention significantly impacted daily life and industry by providing a practical and widespread lighting solution.	Thomas Edison	United States	gas-lighting	Science:Physics	With a source of energy like electricity, there seemed a chance of having light without flame. A current forced across an air gap can produce a bright spark, and arc lights had been previously introduced, but the light was harsh and the danger of fire was great. The problem tackled was finding an alternate form of electric lighting. Electricity passing through a wire warmed it because of the wire’s resistance. If the resistance was made great enough by making the wire thin, the wire would heat to incandescence but could either melt or burn. To prevent burning, the wire filament had to be in an evacuated glass bulb to soften the light and lessen the danger of fire. Finding a conductor that would not melt was the next problem. After thousands of experiments, a solution was found with a scorched cotton thread, equivalent to a carbon wire, which allowed the light to burn for 40 continuous hours. A patent was obtained, and the electric light bulbs were used to illuminate the main street of Menlo Park. To make the light bulb useful, a generating system with electric current provision to homes, factories, and other installations was also developed.	
origin-of-the-moon	1879	Origin of the moon	This hypothesis suggests that the Moon was once part of the Earth and spun off due to the Earth's rapid rotation in its early primordial times. This idea highlights the exchange of angular momentum between the Earth and the Moon, contributing to the lengthening of Earth's day over time.	George Howard Darwin	England	laws-motion	Space	Newton believed that tides were solely a result of the Moon's gravitational pull. George Darwin proposed that as Earth's rotation slowed, its angular momentum was conserved by the Moon gradually moving away from the Earth. This momentum exchange implies that the Moon was once part of Earth, breaking away due to rapid primordial spin. Despite the hypothesis being dramatic and not accepted today, it offered an early explanation for the Earth-Moon system's evolution.	
saccharin	1879	Saccharin	Saccharin is a sweet-tasting compound discovered accidentally during the synthesis of ortho-benzoyl sulfimide. It marked the beginning of artificial sweeteners, providing a substitute for sugar that remains significant today.	Constantine Fahlberg and Ira Remsen	United States	organic-synthesis	Science:Chemistry	In 1879, chemist Constantine Fahlberg, while working on ortho-benzoyl sulfimide, accidentally tasted a sweet compound that had adhered to his fingers. Named saccharin, it was the first commercial sugar substitute, dramatically impacting the food industry by offering an alternative to sugar which is still in use today.	
scandium	1879	Scandium	Scandium is a chemical element discovered as part of the rare earth series but with distinct properties that fulfilled predictions made by Dmitri Mendeleyev. Its discovery reinforced the periodic table by fitting the properties of the previously predicted 'eka-boron'.	Lars Fredrik Nilson	Sweden	rare-earths, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science:Chemistry	Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered scandium in 1879, identifying it as part of the rare earth elements but with unique properties. Following this, chemist Per Teodor Cleve confirmed that scandium's characteristics matched those of 'eka-boron', a predicted element by Dmitri Mendeleyev, thus verifying the predictive power of the periodic table.	
thulium-holmium-samarium	1879	Thulium, holmium, and samarium	Two new rare earth elements, thulium (after Thule) and holmium (after Stockholm), were discovered and named to reflect Scandinavian connections. Another rare earth element, samarium, was also identified in the same year.	Per Teodor Cleve 	Sweden	scandium	Science:Chemistry	If scandium was not quite a rare earth element, other elements were discovered that were. Cleve, who identified scandium as eka-boron (see above), isolated two new rare earth elements in 1879. He gave both of them names of Scandinavian aura. One was thulium, after Thule, which in classic legend was the land farthest to the north, and which was interpreted by later Europeans as representing Scandinavia. The other he named holmium, after Stockholm. In the same year, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who had discovered gallium (see 1874), identified a new rare earth element, which he named samarium, because he had found it in a mineral called samarskite, which, in turn, bore the name of an otherwise obscure Russian mining engineer named Samarski.	
heat-and-radiation	1879	Heat and radiation	The relationship between a body’s temperature and the radiation it emits was established, revealing that radiation increases dramatically with temperature (T^4). This principle, known as Stefan's law, has significant implications for understanding stellar evolution and the radiation of the Sun.	Josef Stefan	Austria	black-bodies	Science:Physics	An Austrian physicist, Josef Stefan (1835-1893), was particularly interested in how hot bodies cooled and, therefore, in how much radiation they emitted. He studied hot bodies over a considerable range of temperature and, in 1879, was able to show that the total radiation of a body was proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (Stefan's law). For example, if a body's temperature tripled, from 1,000° K to 3,000° K, its radiation output would increase 3 x 3 x 3 x 3, or 81 times. This very rapid increase of radiation with temperature was more of an increase than would have been expected and turned out to be of great use in deducing the evolution of stars. More immediately, from the total radiation of the Sun, its surface temperature was deduced from the rule, and turned out to be about 5,700° K.	
malaria	1880	Malaria	The disease-causing microorganism for malaria was discovered to be a protozoon rather than a bacterium. This groundbreaking discovery earned a Nobel Prize and advanced the understanding of malaria's pathology.	Charles-Louis-Alphonse Laveran	France	quinine, bacteriology	Science: Biology	In 1880 a French physician, Charles-Louis-Alphonse Laveran (1845-1922), isolated the microorganism that caused malaria and, to everyone's astonishment, found it to be not a bacterium but a protozoon, a one-celled animal. It was the first pathogenic organism to be found that was anything but a bacterium. For this discovery, Laveran received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1907.	
nebular-photography	1880	Nebular photography	The first photograph of a nebula was taken, shedding light on the composition and characteristics of the Orion nebula. This milestone in astrophotography allowed for significant insights into the nature of nebulas.	Henry Draper	United States	dry-plates	Space	In 1880 Draper (see 1872), who had learned the use of dry plates from Huggins (see 1863), used the new technique to photograph the Orion nebula and to study its spectrum. It was the first time a nebula had been photographed. From its spectrum, it was possible to deduce that the Orion nebula was a cloud of dust and gas lit by stars that must be embedded in it. It would be natural to suppose, as a result, that all other nebulas might be of such composition, but within forty years it turned out that there were all-important exceptions.	
modern-seismograph	1880	Modern seismograph	Advancements were made in developing the first modern seismograph to measure earthquake strength, using a horizontal pendulum system. This development marked the beginning of modern seismology and led to the establishment of seismograph chains worldwide.	John Milne	England	seismograph	Science: Geology	The first attempt to develop a device that would measure the strength of earthquakes had been made by Palmieri (see 1855). In 1880 the first modern seismograph (from Greek words meaning “to record earthquakes”) was devised by a British geologist, John Milne (1850–1913). This was, essentially, a horizontal pendulum, one end of which was fixed in bedrock. When the ground moved as a result of a quake, the motion was re-corded on a turning drum by a pen (eventually by a ray of light). Milne established a chain of seismographs in Japan and elsewhere, which marked the beginning of modern seismology.	
gadolinium	1880	Gadolinium	A new rare earth element, gadolinium, was discovered and named in honor of Gadolin, adding to the known elements in the periodic table. This discovery underscored the ongoing advancements in the field of chemistry.	Jean-Charles-Galissard de Marignac	Switzerland	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	Maringac, who had discovered ytterbium (see 1878), discovered yet another rare earth element in 1880. This time Gadolin, who had discovered the rare earths (see 1794), was honored, and the element was named gadolinium.	
unconscious-mind	1880	Unconscious mind	A significant case in psychology involving patient 'Anna O.' was recorded, in which Anna's symptoms were alleviated when she could be asked to verbalize the fantasies of her unconscious mind. This case contributed to the early foundations of psychoanalysis.	Josef Breuer	Austria		Science: Psychology	In 1880 an Austrian physician, Josef Breuer (1842–1925), acquired a new patient whom he referred to as “Anna O.” She suffered from various psychological issues.	
electromechanical-calculator	1880	Electromechanical calculator	The electromechanical calculator was invented, which used punch cards and electricity to efficiently handle and analyze vast amounts of census data. This invention led to the creation of IBM, impacting data processing significantly.	Herman Hollerith	United States	jacquard-loom, mortality-tables	Science: Computing	The American census was growing more and more elaborate. There were more and more people, and more and more questions were being asked of each person. The information gathered was so voluminous that it took literally years to sort it. An American inventor, Herman Hollerith (1860-1929), who worked for the census, thought there might be a better way of handling the data, and beginning in 1880, he set about the task. He made use of punch cards after the fashion of Jacquard (see 1801) and Babbage (see 1822). Each card could be punched to represent data gathered in the census: holes in appropriate places could represent sex, age, occupation, and so on. In order to add up and analyze all this information, the cards were placed on a stand and a metal device was pressed down against them. The device had many pins, which would be stopped by the cardboard. Wherever there was a hole, however, a pin would go through and reach a pool of mercury underneath. Electricity would pass through that pin and control the pointer on a dial. As the punch cards were sent rapidly through the machine, it was only necessary for people to record the numbers indicated on the dial. What made all the difference between Hollerith and Babbage was that Hollerith had the use of electricity. He had developed an electromechanical calculator, and not merely a mechanical one. Eventually, Hollerith founded a company devoted to making all kinds of machines that could handle and analyze information. That company developed into the International Business Machines Corporation, usually known simply as IBM.	
charged-cathode-rays	1880	Charged cathode rays	Cathode rays were shown to be a stream of negatively charged particles, as opposed to a form of electromagnetic radiation. This discovery clarified the nature of cathode rays, contributing to the understanding of atomic structure.	William Crookes	England	cathode-rays	Science: Physics	There was some question about the nature of the cathode rays to which Goldstein had given a name (see 1876). Most of the reported observations could be explained equally well by supposing cathode rays to be either a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light, or a stream of particles. The matter was investigated by Crookes (see 1861), who in 1875 had devised a vacuum tube that was even better than Geissler’s (see 1855). In 1880, using his own Crookes tube, he showed that cathode rays traveled in straight lines and cast sharp shadows. The radiation could even turn a small wheel, which it struck on one side. This still left the nature of the rays uncertain. But then Crookes showed that a magnet would cause cathode rays to curve in their path, and from the manner of curving, it seemed quite certain that they carried a negative electric charge. Since there seemed no way electromagnetic waves could carry such a charge, Crookes concluded that cathode rays were actually a stream of negatives particles.	
high-pressure	1880	High pressure	A French physicist managed to reach a pressure equal to 3,000 atmospheres, setting a record and laying the groundwork for future work in extreme pressures. This contributed to the study and understanding of the behavior of materials under extreme conditions.	Emile Hilaire Amagat	France	boyles-law, liquefying-gases	Science: Physics	Scientists starting with Boyle (see 1662) had used pressure to study the compression of gases or, as Faraday had, to bring about the liquefaction of gases (see 1823). A French physicist, Emile Hilaire Amagat (1841-1915), was the first, though, to attempt to reach really high pressures and study the behavior of materials under those conditions. He began his experiments in 1880 and soon managed to attain a pressure equal to 3,000 atmospheres. It set a record and laid the groundwork for further work in decades to come at still more extreme pressures.	
piezoelectricity	1880	Piezoelectricity	A crystal of quartz was found to generate an electric potential when subjected to pressure, a phenomenon known as piezoelectricity. If, in reverse, the crystal was subjected to electricity, it would compress as though under pressure, discovering a way to produce ultrasonic vibrations. This led to microphones and record players.	Pierre Curie	France	laws-of-electrolysis	Science: Physics	In 1880 a French chemist, Pierre Curie (1859-1906), noted that if a crystal of quartz was placed under pressure, an electric potential appeared across it. If, in reverse, the crystal was subjected to an electric potential, it would compress as though under pressure. If the electric potential changed rapidly, the crystal would compress and expand in time with the change, and the vibration of the crystal would set up sound waves that oscillated too rapidly to be heard. Curie had thus discovered a way of producing ultrasonic vibrations. The manner in which this is done—the interaction of pressure and electric potentials—is known as piezoelectricity, where piezo comes from the Greek word for “pressure.” Crystals with piezoelectric properties came to form an essential portion of sound-electronic devices such as microphones and record players.	
interferometer	1881	Interferometer	An interferometer was devised to precisely split a beam of light and bring it back together, enabling measurements of the light's phase differences. This experiment contributed significantly by disproving the existence of the supposed luminiferous ether.	Albert Abraham Michelson	United States	lines-of-force, light-waves, five-elements	Science: Physics	In 1881 a German-born American physicist, Albert Abraham Michelson (1852-1931), devised an interferometer, with the financial help of Bell, who had invented the telephone five years before (see 1876). This device acted to split a beam of light in two, send the parts along different paths, then bring them back together—a way of treating light that Maxwell (see 1855) had suggested six years before. Then, no one had had an instrument capable of the job; now Michelson had one. If the two portions of the light traveled precisely the same distance at the same speed, they would then come back together in phase, and the light would be unchanged. If their distance or speed were slightly different, however, the two beams would be slightly out of phase when they rejoined, and interference fringes should be set up such as those Young had detected and used to prove the wave nature of light (see 1801). At this time, it was thought that light, being a wave, had to be a wave of something. Consequently, it was supposed that all space was filled with a luminiferous ether. This luminiferous ether was thought to be in a state of absolute rest, and the Earth was thought to be moving at some particular speed relative to it, called Earth's absolute motion. Michelson used his interferometer to measure Earth's absolute motion by sending two halves of a light beam traveling at right angles to each other. Light sent in the direction of Earth's motion through the ether and back again ought to complete its trip a little sooner than light traveling across the path of Earth's motion. Michelson's experiment with multiply reflected light beams in paths at right angles to each other finally proved the nonexistence of the ether.	
anthrax-inoculation	1881	Anthrax inoculation	Developing an 'attenuated' version of anthrax that conferred immunity to domestic animals, it prevented the spread of a deadly zoonotic disease. This experiment confirmed the feasibility of creating laboratory-made, milder versions of deadly diseases.	Louis Pasteur	France	vaccination, bacterial-cultivation	Science: Biology	It had been three-quarters of a century since Jenner had successfully prevented smallpox by inoculating people with cowpox, a much milder disease that conferred immunity to the more serious one (see 1796). This feat could not be repeated in other cases because other serious diseases did not seem to have milder cousins. Pasteur decided, however, that one might be able to manufacture those milder cousins in the laboratory. Pasteur studied the deadly disease anthrax, which ravaged herds of domestic animals. Koch (see 1876) had reported observing the bacteria responsible for the disease. Pasteur confirmed Koch's finding and showed that the germs sometimes survived in the ground as heat-resistant spores for long periods of time. It was therefore necessary to kill all infected animals and bury them deep. If an animal did survive anthrax, however, it was immune thereafter. Pasteur therefore prepared cultures of anthrax germs and heated them. In this way, he destroyed the activity and virulence of the germs but left an 'attenuated' preparation that could still produce immunity against anthrax. In 1881 he carried through a dramatic experiment. Some sheep were inoculated with his attenuated germs; others were not. After a time, all the sheep seemed healthy, but when they were injected with deadly anthrax germs, those that had been inoculated lived; those that had not been inoculated died.	
pneumococcus	1881	Pneumococcus	Isolated the bacterium responsible for pneumonia, recognizing it as a small spherical type called pneumococcus. This identification facilitated the study of pneumonia's bacteriology and treatment methods.	George Miller Sternberg	United States	bacteriology	Science: Microbiology	The physician George Miller Sternberg (1838-1915) was the American pioneer in bacteriology. In 1881 he isolated the bacterium that caused pneumonia. It was a small spherical bacterium of the kind called coccus (from a Greek word meaning 'seed'). The pneumonia-causing bacterium was therefore called pneumococcus.	
venn-diagram	1881	Venn diagram	Venn diagrams visualize logical relationships using intersecting circles, simplifying the handling of logical statements. This extension of symbolic logic into geometric formats broadened the utility and understanding of logical concepts.	John Venn	England	symbolic-logic	Math	In 1881 the British mathematician John Venn (1834-1923) extended the work of Boole on symbolic logic (see 1847), by representing logical statements as intersecting circles (Venn diagrams). Such circles made it easier to handle statements like 'All A are B' or 'Some A are B' or 'A can be B or C but not both.' If Boole's work was a kind of algebraic logic, Venn's was geometric logic.	
chromatin	1882	Chromatin	Used a synthetic dye called chromatin to study the intimate details of cell structure. This unveiled different parts of a nucleus: nucleoplasm and cytoplasm was developed to better study cell substructures. Also discovered threadlike objects called chromosomes which were a big part of cell division, which Flemming called mitosis.	Eduard Adolf Strasburger & Walther Flemming	Germany	synthetic-dyes, cell-theory	Science: Biology	Studies of the intimate details of cellular structure through the microscope were hampered by the fact that the cell is transparent... German botanist Eduard Adolf Strasburger (1844-1912) was able to observe some of the changes that took place during cell division among plants. In 1882 Strasburger divided protoplasm into two regions, one inside the nucleus, which he called nucleoplasm, and the other outside the nucleus, which he called cytoplasm (the prefix cyto- is from the Greek word for 'cell'). These words, especially cytoplasm, are now common among biologists...	
speed-of-light-interferometer	1882	Speed of light	By timing a flash of light travelling between mirrors in Annapolis, the speed of light was measured to be 186,320 miles per second. This was an improvement from previous measurements and 0.02% from the modern value. 	Albert Abraham Michelson	United States	speed-of-light-experiment, interferometer	Science: Physics	Michelson (the inventor of the interferometer—see 1881), measured the speed of light in 1882 and reported it to be 186,320 miles per second. This was over a thousand miles per second faster than Foucault had reported, and Michelson's value was more accurate. In fact, it was less than 40 miles per second above the value that is currently accepted.	
diffraction-gratings-improved	1882	Improved diffraction gratings	Diffraction gratings were refined to contain around 15,000 lines per inch, enabling the creation of detailed solar spectrum maps. This advancement made it possible to analyze light with much greater precision.	Henry Augustus Rowland	United States	diffraction-gratings	Science: Physics	Fraunhofer had been the first to use diffraction gratings for the formation of light spectra (see 1820). The American physicist Henry Augustus Rowland had devised a method for preparing gratings of unexampled fineness, and in 1882, he prepared a grating in which there were almost 15,000 lines per inch. Eventually, using gratings such as these, Rowland could prepare a map of the solar spectrum in which the precise wavelengths of some 14,000 spectral lines were given.	
tuberculosis	1882	Tuberculosis	Tuberculosis was a very common disease in the nineteenth century. The bacterium causing tuberculosis, known as the tubercle bacillus, was isolated. Identifying this pathogen was a key step in the fight against tuberculosis and earned recognition with a Nobel Prize.	Robert Koch	Germany	bacteriology	Science: Biology	In 1882 Koch isolated the tubercle bacillus, the bacterium that caused tuberculosis. This led him to search for a cure, and for a while he thought he had one, but was disappointed. Still, such was the dread of the disease that merely identifying the germ seemed a feat important enough to warrant granting Koch a Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1905.	
transcendental-pi	1882	Transcendental pi	Pi was proven to be a transcendental number, meaning it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. This mathematical proof has significant implications in number theory and geometry.	Ferdinand von Lindemann	Germany	transcendental-e	Math	In 1882 the German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann studied π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Its value is 3.14159 . . . and so on, forever, in a nonrepeating decimal, for π is an irrational number. Lindemann was able to show that it was more than irrational. It was transcendental, as Hermite had theorized.	
alloy-steel	1883	Alloy steel	The addition of manganese and other metals to steel improved its durability and hardness, extending its usage, particularly in railroad rails. This development marked the start of advanced alloy steels, which incorporated various metals for further enhancements.	Robert Abbott Hadfield	England	bessemer-steel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, discovery-of-niobium	Science: Metallurgy	For three thousand years, steel (carbonized iron) had been the strongest material known for tools, structures, and weapons, but that didn't mean it couldn't be improved. Attempts were made to improve the qualities of steel by adding other metals. Manganese was one of the metals tried, but it seemed to make the steel more brittle. A British metallurgist, Robert Abbott Hadfield (1858–1940), added more manganese than others had thought advisable, however, and when the steel was 12 percent manganese, it was no longer brittle. If it was then heated to 1,000°C and quenched, it became superhard. Where ordinary steel used for railroad rails had to be replaced every nine months, rails made of manganese-steel lasted twenty-two years. Hadfield patented his manganese-steel in 1883, and that marked the beginning of the triumph of alloy steel. Other metals were then added to steel in varying quantities and mixtures—chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, and so on—in search of alloys with new and useful properties.	
alternating-currents	1883	Alternating currents	Electric generators naturally generate alternating current, which rapidly alternates between one direction and the other, with intensity rising and falling like a sine wave. Tesla constructed an induction motor to do useful work.	Nikola Tesla	Croatia	electric-generators	Science: Electrical Engineering	Electric currents, as used in the first half of the nineteenth century, flowed from one point to another in one direction. That is the kind of current one gets from batteries, and it is direct current (dc). It is easier, in	
edison-effect	1883	Edison effect	Seeking to improve his lightbulb by making the filament last longer, Edison discovered that the flow of electricity from a hot filament to a cold wire across a gap in a vacuum tube. This phenomenon laid the groundwork for the future science of electronics.	Thomas Edison	United States	electric-light	Science: Physics	Once Edison had invented the electric light, he naturally endeavoured to improve it. In particular, he wanted to make the filament last longer. In 1883 he sealed a metal wire into a light bulb near the hot filament. Perhaps he thought this might absorb some of the remaining air in the tube and lessen its destructive effect on the filament. To Edison’s surprise, electricity flowed from the hot filament to the cold wire across the gap that separated them. This is called the Edison effect. Edison wrote up the effect meticulously and patented it, as a matter of course, but he could think of no use for it. This was his only purely scientific discovery, and he didn’t follow it up. The Edison effect proved the basis for the science of electronics that was eventually to come.	
rayon	1883	Rayon	Rayon, developed by refining nitrocellulose solutions forced through tiny holes, resembled silk in its fineness and shininess. This first synthetic fiber marked the beginning of synthetic textile production.	Louis-Marie-Hilaire Bernigaud de Chardonnet	France	cellulose	Design: Textiles	The French chemist Louis-Marie-Hilaire Bernigaud de Chardonnet had begun some five years earlier to produce fibers by forcing solutions of nitrocellulose through tiny holes and allowing the solvent to evaporate. He perfected the process in 1883 and found he had a fiber that strongly resembled silk in its fineness and shininess. He called it rayon (from the French word for “a ray of light”) because of its shininess. He used only partly nitrated cellulose, so rayon wasn’t explosive, but it was still uncomfortably inflammable. Rayon was the first synthetic fiber, and it was to be followed by many others.	
meiosis	1883	Meiosis	Meiosis is the process of halving the number of chromosomes in sex cells, ensuring genetic stability across generations. Beneden discovered that the number of chromosones in each species is constant. The discovery provided crucial insight into genetic inheritance and cell division.	Edouard Joseph Louis-Marie van Beneden	Belgium	chromatin, genetics	Science: Biology	The discovery of the mechanism of cell division by Flemming (see 1882) stimulated many biologists into investigating the matter further. The Belgian cytologist Edouard Joseph Louis-Marie van Beneden found that the number of chromosomes in the cells of a particular species was always constant, though the number varied from species to species. (It is now known that there are forty-six chromosomes in human cells.) Furthermore, he discovered that in the formation of the sex cells (that is, the ova and spermatozoa), the division of chromosomes during one of the cell divisions was not preceded by a doubling. Each egg and sperm cell, therefore, ended with only half the usual number of chromosomes. (This halving of number was called meiosis, from a Greek word meaning “to make smaller”.) Consequently, when a sperm cell entered an egg cell in the process of fertilization, the chromosomes reached their normal number for the species, half of them coming from the mother and half from the father.	
phagocytes	1883	Phagocytes	Discovery of phagocytes, semi-independent cells in animals capable of ingesting small particles and bacteria, was made. This discovery highlighted the importance of white blood cells in the immune system.	Élie Metchnikoff	France	bacteriology	Science: Biology	A Russian-born French bacteriologist, Élie Metchnikoff (1845-1916), found that in simple animals there were semi-independent cells that were capable of ingesting small particles. Any damage to the animals brought these cells to the spot at once. In 1883 Metchnikoff followed up this lead and studied more complicated animals. He was able to show that the white cells in blood were also semi-independent and were capable of ingesting bacteria. The white cells flocked to the site of any infection, and what followed was a battle between bacteria and what Metchnikoff called phagocytes (Greek for 'eating cells'). When the phagocytes lost heavily, their disintegrated structures made up pus. The white cells, Metchnikoff held, were an important factor in resistance to infection and disease. For this work, he received a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1908.	
diphtheria	1883	Diphtheria	Discovery of the bacterium causing diphtheria was made. This provided crucial understanding for tackling a serious children's disease.	Edwin Klebs	Germany	bacteriology	Science: Biology	The German pathologist Edwin Klebs (1834-1913) discovered the bacterium responsible for a serious children's disease, diphtheria, in 1883.	
maxim-gun	1883	Maxim gun	The Gatling gun had to be cranked manually. The fully automatic Maxim gun was invented, utilizing bullet recoil for operation. This significantly enhanced military capabilities for European armies.	Hiram Stevens Maxim	England	machine-guns	War	The Gatling gun (see 1862) had to be cranked. In 1883 an American-born, British inventor, Hiram Stevens Maxim (1840-1916), went one step further, with a fully automatic machine gun. It made use of the energy of a fired bullet’s recoil to eject the spent cartridge and load the next. The Maxim gun gave European armies a still greater advantage over native levies in Africa and Asia. One popular jingle of the time went: 'Whatever happens, we have got The Maxim gun, and they have not!' However, the time was to come when non-Europeans found out how to use advanced weapons, and the jingle then lost its luster.	
eugenics	1883	Eugenics	Eugenics ("good breeding") was an attempt to apply selective breeding techniques from animal domestication to humans, but faced many problems, practical and ethical.	Francis Galton 	England	animal-dom, evolution-by-natural-selection	Culture		
stefan-boltzmann-law	1884	Stefan-boltzmann law	The relationship between heat emission and temperature was mathematically refined and led to the formulation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This advancement laid the foundation for statistical mechanics.	Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann	Austria	second-law-of-thermodynamics, heat-and-radiation	Science: Thermodynamics	Stefan had related heat emission to the fourth power of the temperature in 1879, and in 1884, the matter was taken up further by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann. Boltzmann increased the rigor of the mathematical treatment of thermodynamics and emphasized the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics, leading to statistical mechanics. The rule is often called the Stefan-Boltzmann law.	
ionic-dissociation	1884	Ionic dissociation	The theory of ionic dissociation explains how molecules like sodium chloride break into charged fragments called ions, which carry electric current in solution. Initially met with skepticism, it was later recognized as groundbreaking, earning the inventor a Nobel Prize.	Svante August Arrhenius	Sweden	laws-of-electrolysis	Science: Chemistry	A Swedish chemistry student, Svante August Arrhenius (1859–1927), decided that the logical way to explain this was to suppose that sodium chloride molecules broke up into two fragments of opposite electrical charge (such fragments are called ions, a word first used by Faraday—see 1821). The ions carried the current, and since there were twice as many particles as there would have been if the molecule had remained intact, this accounted for the doubled depression of the freezing point. In the same way, barium chloride must break up into three ions, and so on. In 1884 Arrhenius presented his theory of ionic dissociation as his Ph.D. thesis. It was not greeted with enthusiasm, for chemists had assumed for a century that atoms were featureless, indestructible, and unchanging. The thought of atoms carrying electric charges lent them features and a structure, and that was hard to accept. However, Arrhenius's theory made sense in every other way, so he was given a passing grade—but the lowest possible one. In 1903, when key discoveries had been made concerning the atom’s structure, this same thesis obtained for Arrhenius a Nobel Prize. 	
sugar-structure	1884	Sugar structure	The structure of sugars, including their three-dimensional atomic arrangement, was studied to explain their optical activity. It was found that sugars can exist in multiple varieties based on carbon bond arrangements, and they fall into two series, D and L, which are mirror images of each other.	Emil Hermann Fischer	Germany	tetrahedral-carbon-atom	Science: Chemistry	Though sugars had been studied throughout the nineteenth century, and though their atomic content was more or less known, the actual three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms was not known. The work of van’t Hoff, ten years before, had shown the importance of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the way this could be responsible for optical activity (see 1874).	
cocaine	1884	Cocaine	Cocaine, an alkaloid from coca leaves, was used for its pain-relieving properties and tested as a local anesthetic during an eye surgery. This led to developments in safer and more effective local anesthetics.	Karl Koller	Austria	anesthesia	Science: Medicine	Cocaine is an alkaloid obtained from the leaves of the coca bush, which originally grew wild in Peru and Bolivia. The Incas chewed the leaves to suppress feelings of pain and weariness and so be able to endure the strains of life better. Europeans eventually discovered cocaine without understanding at first that it was strongly addictive and therefore dangerous. One of the first to study it was an Austrian physician, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). He did not follow it up but passed on his information to an Austrian colleague, Karl Koller (1857–1944). Freud suggested that cocaine might be a pain-relieving agent, but Koller went further and studied its uses as a local anesthetic (one that would deaden pain in a particular area of the body without producing unconsciousness). In 1884, after having experimented on animals, Koller performed an eye operation on a patient—the first using local anesthesia. It was successful. Eventually, local anesthetics were developed that were more effective, and safer, than cocaine.	
bacterial-staining	1884	Bacterial staining	Bacterial staining involves using synthetic dyes to differentiate types of bacteria as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative. This method became crucial in developing effective antibacterial treatments.	Hans Christian Joachim Gram	Denmark	chromatin	Science: Biology	Bacteria can be stained with synthetic dyes, just as Flemming had shown that ordinary cells can be. In 1884 a Danish bacteriologist, Hans Christian Joachim Gram (1853-1938), stained bacteria with a dye. He found that, when treated with iodine and an alcohol wash, the stain could be removed from some kinds of bacteria but not from others. The bacteria that retained the dye were called Gram-positive, while those that lost it were Gram-negative. The importance of this became apparent once antibacterial agents were developed and it was found that some attacked the Gram-positive varieties and some the Gram-negative ones.	
steam-turbine	1884	Steam turbine	The steam turbine, designed to withstand high temperatures and rapid rotation, revolutionized ship propulsion and electric power generation. This invention led to significant advancements in marine and electrical engineering.	Charles Algernon Parsons	England	turbines	Science: Engineering	Turbines had been devised (see 1827), but none were capable of withstanding the high temperatures to which they would be subjected if they were to be turned by jets of steam and of withstanding the simultaneous stress of rapid rotation while preventing steam from escaping prematurely. In 1884, however, the British engineer Charles Algernon Parsons (1854-1931) constructed the first successful steam turbine. Such devices could be used to power ships, which could then attain unusually high speeds. They could also be used in electric generators.	
linotype	1884	Linotype	The Linotype machine allowed operators to set whole lines of type simultaneously by using a keyboard, significantly speeding up the printing process. This invention became a cornerstone of publishing, particularly for newspapers, for over seventy-five years.	Ottmar Mergenthaler	United States	printing-press, typewriters	General	In 1884 a German-born American inventor, Ottmar Mergenthaler (1854-1899), patented a machine that, when directed by an operator at a keyboard, could set a whole line of type at one time. It was therefore called a Linotype machine. For the next three-quarters of a century it was a mainstay of publishing—especially newspapers, which increasingly had to be turned out steadily and in quantity.	
fountain-pen	1884	Fountain pen	The fountain pen allowed for extended writing periods without frequent ink dips thanks to its built-in reservoir. This advancement replaced the dip pen and became widely used for writing.	Lewis Edson Waterman	United States	writing	General	In 1884 an American inventor, Lewis Edson Waterman (1837-1901), patented a pen with a reservoir that could be filled with ink. The pen could then write for a long time before another filling was called for. The reservoir held a virtual fountain of ink, and before long the fountain pen, with further improvements, had replaced the dip pen almost everywhere. Even the typewriter (see 1867) did not completely remove the need for writing, after all.	
rabies	1885	Rabies	An attenuated preparation was developed to prevent rabies, granting immunity without causing disease. This treatment successfully saved a boy bitten by a mad dog.	Louis Pasteur	France	anthrax-inoculation	Science: Medicine	Pasteur tried to treat the disease as he had treated anthrax (see 1881), by developing an attenuated and feeble preparation of the causative agent that would give immunity but not the disease. He showed that an attenuated agent could be obtained by passing a rabies infection through a variety of different species of animals until its virulence had abated. In 1885 Pasteur made the first use of his attenuated preparation to prevent a case of rabies in a boy, Joseph Meister (1878-1940), who had been bitten by a mad dog. The treatment worked, and the boy was saved.	
purines-and-pyrimidines	1885	Purines and pyrimidines	The molecular structure of nucleic acids was explored by isolating purines and pyrimidines. Two different purines, adenine (A) and guanine (G) and three different pyramidines, uracil (U), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)	Albrecht Kossel	Germany	nucleic-acid, sugar-structure	Science: Biochemistry	Since the nucleic acids had been discovered by Miescher (see 1869), little had been done to determine their molecular structure. Then the German biochemist Albrecht Kossel (1853–1927) took up the matter. He got rid of the proteins associated with the nucleic acids and worked on the material itself. By 1885 he had obtained substances from it that included the double-ring purines Emil Fischer had studied a few years earlier (see 1884). He also obtained pyrimidines, whose molecules were made up of a single ring of atoms, four carbons and two nitrogens. He isolated two different pyrimidine bases, thymine and cytosine.	
praseodymium-and-neodymium	1885	Praseodymium and neodymium	Didymium was found to be a mixture of two rare earth elements, which were separated and named praseodymium and neodymium. This discovery allowed for further scientific understanding and advancements in the study of rare earth elements.	Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach	Austria	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	Didymium was a rare earth element that had been discovered by Mosander some forty years before. Its name is derived from the Greek word for "twin" because it was so like other rare earth elements. However, the name turned out to be more apt than was thought, for the element was actually twins, a mixture of two very similar elements. In 1885, after much careful work, an Austrian chemist, Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach, managed to separate the two elements. One he named praseodymium ("green twin," because of the color of a prominent line in its spectrum) and the other he named neodymium (new twin).	
welsbach-mantle	1885	Welsbach mantle	The Welsbach mantle enhanced gas flame brightness by heating a fabric impregnated with thorium and cerium nitrate, making kerosene lamps competitive with electric lighting. This innovation extended the utility of kerosene lamps for an additional three decades.	Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach	Austria	cerium-osmium-iridium, thorium, kerosene	Science: Chemistry	Von Welsbach was the first to find an important use for the rare earth elements in which he was so interested. It occurred to him that gas flames might be made to give more light if they were allowed to heat up some compound that would itself then glow brightly. He tried many substances that would glow at high heat without melting and finally found that if he impregnated a cylindrical fabric with thorium nitrate, to which a small amount of cerium nitrate (a compound of one of the rare earth elements) had been added, he would obtain a brilliant white glow in a gas flame. This Welsbach mantle, when used in a kerosene lamp, gave such a bright light that it allowed kerosene lamps to compete with electric light for another thirty years or so.	
transformer	1885	Transformer	The transformer, invented to shift voltage and amperage, enabled the efficient transmission of alternating current over long distances, while minimizing energy loss. This invention solidified the victory of alternating current over direct current.	William Stanley	United States	alternating-currents	Science: Physics	In the battle between alternating current and direct current (see 1883), victory went to alternating current, because it could be transformed into another current of much higher voltage and of correspondingly lower amperage (to get something, you have to give up something in the real world). While it is in this high-voltage state, the current can be transported long distances with comparatively little loss. Once it arrives at its destination, it can be reconverted into a low-voltage, high-amperage current again, in which form it can do its work best. For these transformations from low to high voltage and back again, a device was needed that was invented in 1885 by an American electrical engineer, William Stanley, who was working for Westinghouse. His transformer could shift voltage and amperage, but only with alternating current and not with direct current.	
first-automobile	1885	First automobile	Benz's first automobile was a three-wheeler powered by a single-cylinder gasoline engine with a chain-driven back axle. It had a speed of 8 miles per hour and used a steering tiller with rear wheels featuring carriage-type leaf springs.	Carl Friedrich Benz	Germany	steam-locomotive, four-stroke-engine, carriage-springs	Design	Benz’s first automobile of 1885, shown here with the rear cover removed, was a three-wheeler powered by a light-weight, single-cylinder gasoline engine which drove the back axle by means of a chain. A large horizontal flywheel evened out the irregularities of the slow-running 1-horsepower engine. The engine had (unreliable) electric ignition, using a spark plug supplied by a battery and an induction coil, and the vehicle chugged along at eight miles an hour. The smaller front wheel was steered using a tiller, and only the spindly rear wheels had any springing, which was in the form of carriage-type leaf springs. The car has survived, and can still be seen at a museum in Munich. Later automobiles had wooden-spoked wheels, although tiller steering remained standard for many years.	
fingerprints	1885	Fingerprints	The uniqueness of fingerprints was highlighted, establishing that no two people, except identical twins, have the same fingerprints. This laid the foundation for using fingerprints in personal identification, adding a new dimension to forensic medicine.	Francis Galton 	England	illustrated-anatomy	Science: Biology	In 1885 Galton pointed out the individuality of fingerprints. No two people (barring identical twins) had identical fingerprints, and Galton	
aluminum-process	1886	Aluminum process	Aluminum is a common element that was difficult to isolate and used to be considered precious. A new method called the Hall-Héroult process was developed independently by two individuals, making aluminum cheaper and ideal for various uses like aircraft.	Hall and Héroult	United States and France	aluminum, sodium-and-potassium	Science: Chemistry	Aluminum is the most common element in the Earth's crust. It was first isolated by Ørsted (see 1825), but the isolation was so difficult that it was virtually a precious metal. Napoleon III had his cutlery and a baby rattle for the Prince Imperial made out of aluminum, and the capstone on the Washington Monument is a slab of aluminum.In 1886 an American student of chemistry, Charles Martin Hall (1863–1914), heard his teacher say that anyone who discovered a cheap way of making aluminum would grow rich and famous. In his home laboratory, using homemade batteries, Hall devised a method of preparing aluminum by the use of an electric current, as Davy had prepared sodium and potassium nearly eighty years before (see 1807). He used aluminum oxide dissolved in a molten mineral named cryolite, and into it he stuck carbon electrodes.  Oddly enough, that same year a French metallurgist, Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult (1863–1914), with the same last initial and the same birth and death years, independently devised precisely the same system, which is therefore called the Hall-Héroult process.  Aluminum became cheaper almost at once, and it is now second only to steel as a structural material. A combination of lightness and strength makes it ideal for aircraft, for instance.	
germanium	1886	Germanium	Germanium is an element discovered by analyzing a silver ore, which filled the gap predicted by Mendeleyev as eka-silicon. Its properties matched those predicted, validating Mendeleyev's periodic table.	Clemens Alexander Winkler	Germany	periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Chemistry	A German chemist, Clemens Alexander Winkler (1838–1904), analyzed a silver ore and, when he had completed his work, found that the elements he had located added up to only 93 percent of the whole. Puzzled, he searched out the remaining 7 percent and, in 1886, found a hitherto unrecognized element, which he named germanium, after Germany. It turned out to be eka-silicon and filled the one remaining gap for which Mendeleyev had predicted a new element (see 1869). What's more, the properties matched. 	
fluorine	1886	Fluorine	Chemists had long theorized the existence of an element named fluorine, but it was more reactive than oxygen thus very hard to isolate. Using platinum equipment, fluorine was successfully isolated, leading to significant advancements in chemistry.	Henri Moissan	France	malleable-platinum, chlorine	Science: Chemistry	For three-quarters of a century, chemists had known that a certain element must exist. They had even given it a name—fluorine. However, it was a particularly active element, the most active one known, more active than oxygen and chlorine, and nothing seemed capable of forcing it out of combination with other elements. A number of chemists tried to isolate it and found the matter not only difficult but dangerous, for the materials they had to work with were poisonous. Finally, a French chemist, Henri Moissan (1852-1907), tried. He used platinum for all his equipment, because it was one of the very few substances that fluorine would not attack and combine with instantly. If he isolated some fluorine in platinum, that fluorine would stay isolated. He placed a solution of potassium fluoride in hydrogen fluoride in his platinum equipment, chilled it to -50°C to tame the fluorine a bit, and passed an electric current through it on June 26, 1886. He obtained a pale yellow gas that was the long-sought fluorine.	
dysprosium	1886	Dysprosium	While working with rare earth ores, a new element called dysprosium (Greek "hard to get at") was discovered. This advanced the understanding and classification of rare earth elements.	Lecoq de Boisbaudran	France	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who had already isolated gallium (see 1874) and samarium (see 1879), was working on a rare earth ore containing holmium when he discovered that it contained a small amount of still another rare earth element, which he named dysprosium, from a Greek word meaning 'hard to get at.'	
canal-rays	1886	Canal rays	Canal rays were discovered using a perforated cathode, revealing radiation that streamed in the opposite direction. This finding contributed to the understanding of particle physics and radiation.	Eugen Goldstein	Germany	charged-cathode-rays	Science: Physics	Goldstein, who had given cathode rays their name (see 1876), continued to work with them. In 1886 he used a perforated cathode, one with small holes, or channels, penetrating it. When he did this, he found that not only did cathode rays emerge as usual, but radiation passed through the channels and streamed in the opposite direction. He called the radiation Kanalstrahlen, which is German for 'channel rays,' but they were usually called canal rays, by the same mistranslation that had given rise to the notion of Martian canals (see 1877).	
raoults-law	1886	Raoult's law	Raoult's Law demonstrates that the partial pressure of solvent vapors is proportional to the number of solvent molecules to solute molecules in a solution. This law aids in calculating molecular weights and understanding the effects on boiling and freezing points.	François-Marie Raoult	France	ionic-dissociation	Science: Chemistry	The French physical chemist François-Marie Raoult (1830–1901) showed in 1886 that the partial pressure of solvent vapors in equilibrium with a solution is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of solvent molecules to solute molecules. This is called Raoult's law. To the nonchemist, the law may seem unclear, but it provided chemists with a new way of calculating the molecular weight of dissolved substances. It also showed that the freezing point was depressed, and the boiling point elevated, in proportion to the number of particles present in a given volume of solution. Arrhenius had assumed this when he had worked out his theory of ionic dissociation two years earlier (see 1884).	
nitrogen-fixation	1886	Nitrogen fixation	Plants require nitrogen for growth and absorb it from nitrates in the soil. It was discovered that leguminous plants have bacteria on their roots that fix nitrogen from the air into a usable form, aiding soil fertility.	Hermann Hellriegel	Germany	agriculture, bacteriology	Science: Biology	Plants must have nitrogen atoms to build their tissues, and they get them from nitrates in the soil. There are enormous amounts of nitrogen in the atmosphere, but nitrogen itself is not active, and it is not easy to force it into combination with other substances. The German chemist Hermann Hellriegel (1831-1895) discovered in 1886 that some leguminous plants (peas, beans, and related species) had root nodules that contained nitrogen-fixing bacteria (that is, bacteria that could affix nitrogen to other kinds of elements, eventually forming nitrates). Since there is always a danger that plants will consume the nitrates in soil, causing it to decline in fertility, it was useful to know that the planting of leguminous plants would restore the fertility of the soil—at least with respect to nitrogen. 	
michelson-morley-experiment	1887	Michelson-Morley experiment	An experiment aimed to detect the Earth's motion through the ether yielded no results, challenging existing scientific theories. This 'failure' became a pivotal point in the development of modern physics.	Michelson and Morley	United States	interferometer	Science: Physics	Michelson, who had hoped to determine the Earth’s speed of motion through the stationary ether (see 1881), continued to improve the delicacy of his procedure and of his instruments, and to repeat the experiment. Finally, in 1887, with the help of a colleague, the American chemist Edward Williams Morley (1838-1923), Michelson ran a definitive experiment and, once again, found no interference fringes. There had to be an explanation. Either the Earth was motionless with respect to the ether, or the Earth dragged the ether with it, or something. All possible explanations seemed highly unlikely, and for nearly a quarter of a century, the world of science was completely puzzled. It took a scientific revolution to explain the matter, so that the Michelson-Morley experiment is perhaps the most important “failure” in the history of science.	
photoelectric-effect	1887	Photoelectric effect	Hertz set up an electrical circuit that oscillated between two metal balls separated by an air gap, sending a spark across the gap whenever potential reached a peak. Hertz noted that when UV light shone on the negative terminal, the balls sparked more readily. This was the first observation of the photoelectric effect.	Heinrich Rudolph Hertz	Germany	maxwells-equations	Science: Physics	The German physicist Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857-1894) was interested in Maxwell’s equations (see 1865). As part of his investigation of electromagnetic effects in the light of those equations, he set up an electrical circuit that oscil-	
mach-number	1887	Mach number	As technology advanced so did the sped with which humans could move. Mach studied the relationship between speed of an object and the speed of sound through air, identifying critical changes in air resistance. It led to important advancements in aerodynamics and high-speed travel.	Ernst Mach	Austria	steam-locomotive-improved, aerodynamics	Science: Physics	With advancing technology, human beings were traveling faster than they had in the past, and they were likely to travel faster still in the future. The faster human beings traveled, the more important air resistance would be. The Austrian physicist Ernst Mach (1838–1916) studied the conditions that occurred when a solid object and air were in rapid motion relative to each other. The natural rate at which air molecules can move is the speed of sound through air. When an object moves through air at higher speeds, the air molecules can no longer move aside naturally but must be shoved aside (so to speak) faster than they want to go. This produces new conditions, which Mach studied.	
rubber-tire	1887	Rubber tire	The invention of the rubber tire, particularly the pneumatic version, significantly improved wheeled transportation by providing better durability and shock absorption. It led to major advancements in the design and comfort of vehicles.	John Boyd Dunlop	England	vulcanization-of-rubber, cart	Design	Since wheeled transportation had been invented five thousand years before, wheels had wooden or metal rims. These were noisy and offered no spring, so that travel on carts and wagons was a jolting affair. In 1887 a British inventor, John Boyd Dunlop (1840–1921), decided to rim the wheels of his son’s tricycle with a rubber tire (and patented the notion the following year). Rubber, though soft, actually wears better than wood or iron does. What’s more, Dunlop made it a pneumatic tire: what went round the rim was an air-filled tube, which was covered by a tire with a rubber tread. This gave a vehicle spring and cut down the noise tremendously, so that tires were soon used for automobiles and other vehicles as well.	
radio-waves	1888	Radio waves	Long-wave electromagnetic radiation, or radio waves, were discovered by Hertz with the help of a simple detector coil. This validated Maxwell's equations and expanded the known electromagnetic spectrum to include wavelengths far longer than visible light.	Heinrich Rudolph Hertz	Germany	photoelectric-effect	Science: Physics	When Hertz was performing the experiments that gave him the first glimpse of a photoelectric effect (see 1887), he expected that the oscillating current he was working with would produce an electromagnetic wave. Each oscillation should produce a wave, and the wave should be very long. After all, since light that travels a bit over 186,000 miles per second, a wavelength formed in an oscillation of a mere hundred-thousandth of a second will still be nearly 2 miles long. In 1888, he actually observed such waves. Hertz used, as a device for detecting the possible presence of such long-wave radiation, a simple loop of wire, with a small air gap at one point. Just as the current in his first coil gave rise to radiation, so the radiation produced ought to give rise to a current in the second coil. Sure enough, Hertz was able to detect small sparks jumping across the gap in his detector coil.  By moving his detector coil to various parts of the room, Hertz could tell the shape of the waves by the intensity of the spark formation and could calculate a wavelength of 2.2 feet. This is a million times the size of a wavelength of ordinary light. He also managed to show that the waves were electromagnetic in nature. At first these long-wave radiations were called Hertzian waves, but later the name radio waves came into use instead. In this way, Hertz verified the usefulness of Maxwell's equations and showed that light was only a tiny section of the electromagnetic spectrum. 	
le-chateliers-principle	1888	Le Châtelier's principle	Le Châtelier's principle describes how systems in equilibrium respond to changes in environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature. It explains that systems will adjust in a way that counteracts or minimizes the imposed change.	Henri-Louis Le Châtelier	France	law-of-mass-action, chemical-thermodynamics	Science: Chemistry	The French chemist Henri-Louis Le Châtelier (1850–1936) stated a rule in 1888 that became known as Le Châtelier’s principle. The rule is this: Every change in one of the factors of an equilibrium brings about a rearrangement of the system in such a direction as to minimize the original change. If a system in equilibrium is placed under increased pressure, for instance, the system rearranges itself to take up less room, so as to minimize the increased pressure. Again, if the temperature is raised, the system undergoes a change that absorbs some of the additional heat, so as to minimize the rise in temperature.	
chromosome	1888	Chromosome	Chromosomes are the stubby threads of chromatin that appear during cell division. The term became widely known in the scientific community and to the general public.	Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz	Germany	chromatin	Science: Biology	In 1888 the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz (1836-1921) suggested that the stubby threads of chromatin that appeared during cell division be called chromosomes. This has become one of those scientific terms that is well known to the public at large.	
greenland-ice-cap	1888	Greenland ice cap	Fridtjof Nansen successfully crossed Greenland, demonstrating it was covered by a significant ice cap. That one ice cap is now known to contain ~8% of all the ice in the world.	Fridtjof Nansen	Norway	greenland	Geography	In 1888 the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930) landed on the eastern shore of Greenland with five others. All six managed to cross to the inhabited western shore in a six-week trek. It was the first time Greenland had ever been crossed. The crossing seemed to indicate that the entire interior of Greenland was buried under a huge ice cap, a last remnant of the Ice Age. That one ice cap is now known to contain about 8 percent of all the ice in the world.	
home-photography	1888	Home photography	George Eastman introduced a simplified camera and flexible film system called Kodak, making photography accessible to everyone. The innovation led to widespread use of cameras in homes.	George Eastman	United States	photographic-negative, dry-plates	Design	The American inventor George Eastman (1854-1932) simplified the process. He substituted a flexible film for the large and inflexible piece of glass on which photographic emulsion was spread and dried. With a film that could be rolled compactly, cameras could be made much smaller. In 1888 Eastman developed a camera that weighed only about 2 pounds. He called it the Kodak, a meaningless name but one Eastman thought would be catchy and easily remembered. It had the film rolled up in it, and all the owner had to do was to point the camera, press a button, then send the camera to Rochester. Eventually, the photograph and the newly loaded camera were sent back. The Kodak slogan was “You press the button—we do the rest.” There were many improvements to come, but the Kodak started the process that allowed anyone and everyone to take photographs. The camera entered the home and began to make itself universal.	
neuron-theory	1889	Neuron theory	Neuron theory posits that the nervous system is built out of separate cells called neurons, which remain distinct from each other nearly touching one another. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal used staining techniques that worked out the cellular structure of the brain and spinal cord in detail, firmly establishing this theory.	Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal	Italy and Spain	chromatin	Science: Biology	Of all the cells, the nerve cells seem most complex, and of all the organs and systems of organs, the brain and nervous system seem most complex. Moreover, of all the parts of a human body, the brain and nervous system are, or should be, the most interesting, since it is they that make us human. Waldeyer-Hartz (see 1888) was the first to maintain that the nervous system was built out of separate cells and their delicate extensions. The delicate extensions, he pointed out, approached each other closely but did not actually meet, much less join, so that the nerve cells remained separate. He called the nerve cells neurons, and his thesis that the nervous system is composed of separate neurons is the neuron theory. An Italian histologist, Camillo Golgi (1843 or 1844–1926), fifteen years before, had devised a system of staining with silver compounds that brought out the structure of neurons in fine detail. Using this stain he could demonstrate that Waldeyer-Hartz’s views were correct. He could show that fine processes did indeed issue from the neurons and that those from one neuron approached but did not touch those of neighboring neurons. The tiny gaps between one neuron and the next are called synapses (oddly enough, from a Greek word meaning “union,” which they appeared to be at a casual glance but were not in actuality). A Spanish histologist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934), improved on Golgi’s stain, and by 1889 had worked out the cellular structure of the brain and spinal cord in detail, firmly establishing the neuron theory. For their work on the neuron theory, Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1906.	
tetanus	1889	Tetanus	The modernization efforts in Japan allowed scholars to adapt and excel in Western scientific practices, exemplified by advancements in understanding diseases like tetanus. Japanese researchers bridged cultural gaps in scientific knowledge.	Shibasaburo Kitao	Japan	bacteriology	Science: Biology	The modernization of Japan included an orientation of Japanese scholars toward western science, for which they showed a ready aptitude. (This is true of scholars in all nations. There is no such thing as “western” science in the sense that it can only come out of western minds.) Thus, a Japanese bacteriologist, Shibasaburo Kita-	
axiomatics	1889	Axiomatics	Inspired by redefinitions of Euclidian geometry, Peano used symbolic logic to define natural numbers, beginning with formally defined concepts of zero, number, and successor, and developing it up to algebra.	Giuseppe Peano	Italy	non-euclidean-geometry, symbolic-logic	Math	The work of Lobachevsky and others in non-Euclidean geometry (see 1826) had highlighted the importance of choosing different systems of axioms to develop different types of geometry. The work of Boole on symbolic logic (see 1847) seemed to offer a tool for testing the necessary axioms of mathematics generally. In 1889 an Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), published A Logical Exposition of the Principles of Geometry.	
energy-of-activation	1889	Energy of activation	The energy of activation concept explained why certain reactions require an initial energy input to start. This understanding led to insights into chemical reactions and chain reactions.	Svante August Arrhenius	Sweden	chemical-thermodynamics	Science: Chemistry	It was the experience of early humans that fires were hard to start but that once started, they kept right on going with no further trouble as long as they were fed fuel. This is also true of many chemical reactions. Nevertheless, a reaction that ordinarily yields energy when it proceeds will not take place spontaneously until energy is added to it. The reaction has to be activated, by breaking molecules apart, perhaps, so that individual atoms or molecular fragments can react with each other more freely. The energy required is called the energy of activation. Once the reaction starts, it yields energy that can be used to activate neighboring parts of the initial substance. Thus, when you heat a hydrogen and oxygen mixture and a small amount begins to react, the energy it produces will cause a wave of reaction to spread to other parts of the mixture so rapidly that it explodes. This is a chain reaction, since each step leads to the next, as each link in a chain leads to the next. Arrhenius (see 1884) analyzed the energy activation concept systematically in 1889 and brought about new understanding of chemical reactions, of chain reactions, and of explosions.	
spectroscopic-binaries	1889	Spectroscopic binaries	Spectroscopic binaries are binary stars that are too close to be observed as separate stars through a telescope. They were identified by their spectral lines shifting due to their motion relative to Earth.	Pickering and Vogel	United States and Germany	binary-stars, constitution-of-the-stars	Space	Binary stars had been known since Herschel had discovered them nearly a century before (see 1781). However, they could be detected optically only if they were far enough apart to be seen as separate objects in a telescope. What if the pair were so far away or so close together (or both) that they could not be distinguished? In 1889 the American astronomer Edward Charles Pickering (1846–1919) noted that Mizar, the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper, had dark lines that divided in two. They moved apart, then came together, joined, and moved apart again in the opposite direction. He suspected that what he was viewing was a binary star with components so close together they could not be seen separately. However, as they circled each other in the plane of his line of sight, one was advancing and the other receding, so that the former showed a violet shift and the latter a red shift. After they had swung about each other, the one that was receding began to advance and vice versa. His assistant, Antonia Caetana Maury (1866–1952), worked out the period of this spectroscopic binary—104 days—and then went on to discover a second such star, Beta Aurigae, with a period of 4 days. The following year, a German astronomer, Hermann Karl Vogel (1842–1907), independently discovered spectroscopic binaries.	
mercurys-rotation	1889	Mercury's rotation	The rotation of Mercury was studied using its surface markings, and Schiaparelli found some, which he always saw in the same position. He concluded that Mercury always presented the same side to the sun, which was consistent with the Sun's tidal influences to produce this effect.	Giovanni Schiaparelli	Italy	martian-canals	Space	Schiaparelli, who had been the first to see the markings on Mars that were interpreted as canals (see 1877), went on to study the markings on Mercury. Mercury was a smaller world than Mars and farther away. It was often lost in the Sun’s glare, and when it could be seen best, only a crescent	
cordite	1889	Cordite	Cordite is a smokeless explosive substance made from a mix of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. It allowed clearer views on battlefields and marked an advance over traditional gunpowder.	Frederick Augustus Abel, James Dewar	England	nitroglycerine, cellulose	War	For four centuries, gunpowder had ruled the battlefield. It produced a smoke and a stench, however, and battlefields hidden under a thickening pall of gunpowder smoke made adequate generalship difficult. An English chemist, Frederick Augustus Abel (1827-1902), worked on the problem of developing explosives that would not produce smoke. In 1889, with the help of another British chemist, James Dewar (1842-1923), he developed cordite.	
motion-pictures	1889	Motion pictures	Motion pictures simulate motion by displaying images in quick succession. Edison invented a method to extend such illusions in time by using a strip of film with perforations which would be moved by sprocket wheels and a flashing light at a carefully regulated speed.	Thomas Edison	United States	photography, home-photography	Design	Once photography had been invented (see 1839), it seemed natural to use it to simulate motion. If photographs are taken of a moving object in quick succession and flashed before the eyes rapidly, the eye retains an image of each for a brief while, so that all the flashings melt together and are not seen as separate images. Instead, the object photographed seems to move. Such devices were constructed, but generally they showed very brief movements that might be repeated over and over again. Primitive as such devices were, they amused the audience. Edison thought of a way to extend such illusions and perpetuate them for a considerable length of time. He used a strip of film, of the type brought into production by Eastman (see 1888), and took a series of closely spaced photographs of a moving object, which he placed along its length. The film could then be moved by means of perforations along the sides over sprocket wheels, which could push the film in front of a flashing light at a carefully regulated speed. In effect, Edison had invented motion pictures. With a steady stream of improvements, they developed into a giant industry as indispensable to modern life as the automobile.	
antitoxin	1890	Antitoxin	A microorganism sometimes produces a substance which causes a disease (a toxin). Behring successfully produced immunity against tetanus by injecting small doses of blood serum from another animal suffering tetanus. This also worked for diphteria, a common and fatal children's disease.	Emil Adolf von Behring	Germany	diphtheria, tetanus	Science: Medicine	A microorganism itself may not be the immediate cause of a disease, but some substance it produces may be (a toxin, from a Greek word for “poison”). An organism stricken with the disease then produces a substance (an antitoxin) capable of neutralizing the toxin. If the organism recovers, the antitoxin present in its bloodstream confers immunity to the disease thereafter.A German bacteriologist, Emil Adolf von Behring (1854–1917), decided in 1890 that it might be possible to produce an immunity against tetanus, in an animal, by injecting into it graded doses of blood serum from another animal suffering from tetanus. Enough of the serum would be given to induce antitoxin formation, but not enough to cause it to die. It was found that the animal thus immunized could then be used as a source of antitoxin that could confer at least temporary immunity on still another animal, or in a human being. Behring tried this also in the case of diphtheria, a disease that was in those days common among children and often fatal. The diphtheria antitoxin, once marketed, not only conferred a certain immunity, but helped defeat the disease even after it had established itself. For this work, Behring received the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1901, the first year in which Nobel Prizes were awarded.	
java-man	1890	Java man	Skeletal remains of an early human ancestor, Java Man, was found. These hominids were believed to be more primitive than Neanderthals and are now called Homo Erectus. This discovery added significant knowledge about human evolution.	Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois	Netherlands	neanderthal-man	Science: Paleontology	The skeletal remains of Neanderthal man had been uncovered thirty-four years earlier (see 1856), but although the Neanderthals possessed some primitive features, they had brains as large as our own. A truly primitive human ancestor had not yet been discovered.By this time, though, the anthropoid apes were well known, and a Dutch paleontologist, Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (1858–1941), believed that primitive human beings would be found where the anthropoid apes now were: in sections of Africa and southeast Asia. He could not easily reach Africa, but the Indonesian islands were Dutch territory, and Dubois, who was serving in the army, managed	
spectroheliograph	1890	Spectroheliograph	The spectroheliograph was invented to photograph the Sun's spectrum in a small band of wavelengths, aiding in detailed study of its outer chemistry. It enabled the examination of specific wavelengths like calcium.	George Ellery Hale	United States	stellar-photography	Space	In 1890, American astronomer George Ellery Hale invented the spectroheliograph, a device allowing the photography of the Sun's light spectrum, especially calcium wavelengths. This innovation made it possible to study the Sun's outer chemistry in detail.	
surgical-gloves	1890	Surgical gloves	Rubber gloves were introduced in surgery to prevent infections and improve hygiene. These could be more easily sterilized than human hands without cutting down on the hand's ability to touch. This innovation marked the transition from antiseptic (killing germs) to aseptic (no germs at all) surgical techniques.	William Stewart Halsted	United States	antiseptic-surgery	Science: Medicine	In 1890, American surgeon William Stewart Halsted introduced the use of rubber gloves in surgery to prevent infections and dermatitis, marking the shift from antiseptic to aseptic surgery, a major advance in surgical practices.	
asteroid-photography	1891	Asteroid photography	Asteroid photography involves using a telescope to capture images of asteroids as the earth turns. This method allowed for more precise calculation of asteroid orbits and helped Halsted discover the 323rd known asteroid and then 500 more in his life.	Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf	Germany	asteroids, stellar-photography	Science: Astronomy	It had been almost a century now since the first asteroid was discovered by Piazzi (see 1802), and others had been discovered in astonishing numbers. By 1891, 322 asteroids had been discovered and their orbits calculated. Each one, however, had been discovered by eye; an object would be seen that looked like a rather dim star but would be shifting position against the starry background. If it moved at a certain rate, it was almost certainly an asteroid. In 1891 it occurred to a German astronomer, Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf (1863-1932), to make the discoveries by photography. If a telescope is set to turning in time with the movement of the vault of the sky (a movement that arises because of the rotational motion of the Earth), then all the stars in the telescopic view will show up on the film as sharp points. An asteroid, however, will move with respect to the stars and so will show up as a small dash. The object responsible for the dash can then be put under observation and its orbit eventually calculated. In this fashion, Wolf discovered the 323rd asteroid, which he named Brucia, and went on to discover others. In the course of his life, he discovered 500 asteroids. Nowadays, the orbits of nearly 2000 asteroids are known, and it is estimated that there may be as many as 100,000 asteroids that are at least a mile across.	
gravitational-and-inertial-mass	1890	Gravitational and inertial mass	Gravitational mass relates to the intensity of an object’s gravitational field required for a given distance, whereas inertial mass is defined by the resistance to change in velocity. Through careful measurements, these two kinds of mass were found to be identical. This led to a new way of looking at gravity.	Roland Eötvös	Hungary	laws-motion	Science: Physics	Newton had defined mass in terms of the amount of acceleration produced in a body through the application of a force of a given magnitude. This is called the inertial mass, because the greater the mass of a body, the less acceleration a given force produces and the greater the inertia (the resistance to a change in velocity). Newton also found that the intensity of an object’s gravitational field at a given distance depended upon its mass. That is the gravitational mass. These two kinds of mass were determined by two entirely different kinds of observations and would seem to have no necessary connection, yet the mass determined by inertial effects always seemed to be the same as the mass determined by gravitational effects. A Hungarian physicist, Roland Eötvös (1848-1919), saw that if the gravitational mass and the inertial mass were truly identical, then objects in a given gravitational field would always drop (in a vacuum) at the same rate, regardless of mass.	
fundamental-unit-of-electricity	1891	Fundamental unit of electricity	The theory proposed that electricity exists in fundamental particles called electrons, which carry electric charges. This theory had yet to be proven.	George Johnstone Stoney	Ireland	ionic-dissociation	Science: Physics	Arrhenius's theory of ionic dissociation (see 1884) made it look as though atoms or groups of atoms could carry electric charges. What's more, it looked as though atoms or atom groups would carry charges of different sizes that were related to each other in ratios of exact whole numbers. An Irish physicist, George Johnstone Stoney (1826-1911), suggested that electricity existed in fundamental particles, as matter did, and that all these particles carried the same electric charge. A particular atom or atom group would then carry one of these particles, or two or three, and that was why the ratios would be in whole numbers. He suggested in 1891 that the fundamental particle be called an 'electron'. This didn't seem to make much of an impression at the time, but four years later it was to come into its own.	
carborundum	1891	Carborundum	Carborundum (or silicon carbide) is a compound of silicon and carbon created by heating carbon strongly with clay. It proved to be a harder material than anything else at the time and became very useful in industry as an abrasive.	Edward Goodrich Acheson	United States	diamond	Science: Chemistry	People from the earliest times have needed abrasives; that is, hard substances that can grind down softer substances, removing unevenness and imparting a smooth polish to the surface. The diamond is made up of carbon atoms symmetrically placed in tetrahedral patterns, and they are very close to each other as well since the carbon atoms are so small. Therefore, the atoms in diamonds cling together more tightly than in any other substance, so that diamond is by far the hardest material known. Perfect diamonds are too beautiful to use for anything other than show and ornamentation, but imperfect diamonds, or diamond dust, can be used as abrasives. Even imperfect diamonds, however, are in short supply. Graphite is also made of carbon atoms, but in a different, looser arrangement. It is so far from being an abrasive that it can be used as a lubricant. By Le Châtelier's principle (see 1888), however, if graphite is placed under great pressure, its atoms should take up a more compact arrangement and it should become diamond (as it does under great pressure deep underground). Various scientists had tried to supply the necessary pressure, but up to this time none had succeeded. An American inventor, Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856-1931), made the attempt too. He did not succeed in forming diamond either, but in 1891, he found that when he heated carbon strongly with clay, he obtained what he eventually found to be a compound of silicon and carbon, or silicon carbide. Silicon is much like carbon in its properties, so that the atoms of silicon carbide have a diamond arrangement with a silicon atom taking the place of every other carbon. Silicon is a larger atom and doesn't hold together quite as tightly as carbon atoms do, so silicon carbide is not quite as hard as diamond. Still, it was harder than anything else known at the time, and much cheaper than diamond. Acheson called the new compound carborundum, and it became extremely useful in industry as an abrasive.	
glider-improved	1891	Improved gliders	The first human-carrying gliders were improved with curved wings, proving superior to flat wings for gliding. This advancement led to the increased popularity of gliding and paved the way for the invention of the airplane.	Otto Lilienthal	Germany	glider	General	Four decades had passed since Cayley had built the first glider capable of carrying a human being (see 1853). Now a German aeronautical engineer, Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896), made them into things of grace and ability. As early as 1877 he had shown that curved wings were superior to flat wings as far as gliding was concerned. In 1891 he launched himself on his first glide. He died a few years later in a crash landing, but he made gliding popular, and it turned out to be not too long a step from a glider to an airplane.	
amalthea	1892	Amalthea	A small satellite of Jupiter, named Amalthea, was discovered to be small close to the planet, analogous to the discoveries of Mars small moons. It was the last Jovian satellite identified without the use of photography.	Edward Emerson Barnard	United States	jupiter-moons, martian-satellites	Space	Galileo had discovered the four large satellites of Jupiter (see 1610). In the interval since, no other Jovian satellite had been discovered, even though Saturn, a smaller and more distant planet, was known to have eight satellites by this time. The American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard (1857–1923) reasoned, as Hall had in connection with Mars (see 1877), that a fifth satellite, if it existed, would have to be small and close to Jupiter. He searched the neighborhood of Jupiter and in 1892 spotted a satellite only 112,500 miles from Jupiter’s center and only 68,000 miles above Jupiter’s cloud surface. We now know it to be only 125 miles in diameter. It was variously called Barnard’s satellite and Jupiter V (because it was the fifth satellite to be discovered), but the French astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842–1925) suggested it be named Amalthea, after the goat (or nymph) that served as wet-nurse for Jupiter (Zeus) during the god’s infancy. Amalthea was the twenty-first satellite to be discovered and the last to be discovered without photography.	
light-pressure	1892	Light pressure	The pressure exerted by light, predicted by Maxwell’s equations, was measured using light mirrors in a vacuum. This discovery provided experimental evidence for the pressure of light.	Pyotr Nikolayevich Lebedev	Russia	maxwells-equations, geissler-tubes	Science: Physics	From Maxwell’s equations (see 1865) one could deduce that light ought to exert a pressure, albeit a very feeble one. The Russian physicist Pyotr Nikolayevich Lebedev (1866–1912) checked the point by making use of very light mirrors in a vacuum. In 1892 he was able to observe and measure the pressure exerted by light.	
fitzgerald-contraction	1892	Fitzgerald contraction	An explanation for the negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment was proposed, suggesting that distances contract with speed. This theory influenced the understanding of the behavior of light and motion but seemed unsatisfying.	George Francis FitzGerald	Ireland	michelson-morley-experiment	Science: Physics	For five years the negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment had puzzled physicists. The Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald (1851–1901) offered an explanation in 1892. He suggested that distances contracted with speed. If a light source sped along toward point A at a certain velocity, then the light it emitted in the direction of that velocity had to cover a slightly smaller distance to reach point A than light emitted in other directions. The faster the source moved, the shorter the distance light would have to travel to reach a point that would seem to be a fixed distance away to a motionless observer. That change in distance would keep the light moving in different directions in phase.	
dewar-flask	1892	Dewar flask	A double-walled flask with a vacuum between the walls was constructed to help transport heat for low-temperature work. It became commercially known as thermos bottles for keeping drinks hot or cold.	James Dewar	England	black-bodies	Science: Physics	Dewar (see 1889) in 1892 constructed a double-walled flask with a vacuum between the walls. He was interested in low-temperature work, and very cold liquids such as liquid nitrogen, if kept in such a double-walled flask, would gain heat from the outside only slowly. Dewar cut down on transport by radiation even more by covering the interior of the double walls with a mirror surface so that radiation would be reflected rather than absorbed. These were called Dewar flasks and proved indispensable to low-temperature work. They also entered the commercial home market, where they sold as thermos bottles for keeping cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot.	
psychoanalysis	1893	Psychoanalysis	Psychoanalysis involved using free association, allowing patients to talk randomly with minimal guidance, which helped reveal repressed matters. This method showed advantages over hypnotism in treating mental diseases.	Breuer and Freud	Austria	unconscious-mind, hypnotism	Science: Psychology	Breuer had started to use hypnotism in the treatment of mental diseases such as hysteria (see 1880). The method had later been taken up by Freud (see 1884), but he eventually abandoned hypnotism for free association, allowing the patient to talk randomly and at will with a minimum of guidance. In this fashion, the patient was gradually put off guard, and matters came to be revealed that in ordinary circumstances would have been kept secret from the patient's conscious mind. The advantage of this method over hypnotism	
cattle-fever	1893	Cattle fever	Texas cattle fever was identified as being caused by a protozoan parasite (just like malaria) and spread by blood-sucking ticks. This discovery provided the first clear evidence that arthropods could transmit diseases.	Theobald Smith	United States	malaria	Science: Biology	In 1893 the American pathologist Theobald Smith (1859-1934) reported that Texas cattle fever was caused by a protozoan parasite, as had been found to be true of malaria thirteen years before. Smith went on to show that the parasite was spread from infected animals to healthy ones by blood-sucking ticks. This was the first definite indication that disease could be spread by an arthropod. Ticks were among the arachnids (the spider family), but it would soon be shown that blood-sucking insects could also be responsible for the spread of disease.	
wavelengths-and-temperature	1893	Wavelengths and temperature	Wilhelm Wien demonstrated that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by an object varies inversely with its absolute temperature. This relationship helps explain the color changes in heated objects and contributes to our understanding of thermal radiation.	Wilhelm Wien	Germany	heat-and-radiation	Science: Physics	At any temperature above absolute zero, objects give off electromagnetic radiation. In general, very long wavelengths are rare, as are very short wavelengths. Somewhere in between there is a peak wavelength, which is radiated to a greater extent than any other. The German physicist Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928) demonstrated this by actually measuring the wavelengths. In 1893 he was able to show that the peak wavelength varies inversely with absolute temperature. As the temperature rises, not only does the total amount of radiation increase, in line with Stefan's finding (see 1879), but the peak wavelength decreases.  Thus, warm bodies radiate chiefly in the infrared, of which we are unaware except as a feeling of warmth. As temperature goes up, the peak slides toward the visible red, and eventually enough red is produced to give the body a deep red glow. It is then "red-hot." With further temperature rise, the red brightens, grows orange, yellowish, and then white, by which time the peak is in the yellow and all the wavelengths of light are well represented, as in the case of the Sun.  Some stars are so hot that the peak wavelength is in the ultraviolet. Such stars gleam with an intense blue-white light.  For his work on radiation, Wien received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1911.	
alternating-current-theory	1893	Alternating current theory	Developed the mathematical details essential for designing efficient alternating current equipment. His work facilitated the widespread adoption of alternating current over direct current in electrical systems.	Charles Proteus Steinmetz	United States	alternating-currents, imaginary-numbers	Science: Engineering	Tesla had made alternating current useful (see 1883). By 1893 a German-born American electrical engineer, Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865-1923), had worked out the intricacies of alternating current circuitry in complete mathematical detail, making use of complex numbers. This made it possible to design alternating current equipment with increased efficiency. Steinmetz's mathematics spread among the electrical engineering profession and completed the victory of alternating current over direct current. (The house current we draw on whenever we plug an electrical device into a wall socket is invariably alternating current.)	
arctic-ocean	1894	Arctic ocean	A strong ship named Fram was designed to withstand Arctic sea ice and carry explorers close to the North Pole. The expedition got closer to the Pole than anyone before.	Nansen	Norway	greenland-ice-cap, ironclad-warships	Geography	Nansen, who had crossed Greenland (see 1888), now made ready to explore the Arctic Ocean. He designed a strong ship that would be lifted, rather than crushed, when the ocean about it froze. He named the ship Fram (Forward) and set sail in 1893 with thirteen men aboard. His idea was to let himself be frozen in by the sea ice and carried along with it in its slow swirl about the Arctic Ocean, perhaps reaching the North Pole itself. He remained on the ship for a year and a half, and although he never reached the North Pole, he got closer to it (86.23 degrees North) than anyone before him ever had.	
argon	1894	Argon	The atomic weight of nitrogen was found to vary based on its source. To resolve this inconsistency Ramsay used the same technique Cavendish used to discovering hydrogen. The result was a verifiably new gas, proven through spectrometry. He called this new element argon ("inert" in Greek).	John William Strutt and William Ramsay	Scotland	spectral-lines-and-elements, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Chemistry	Ever since Prout had suggested that all atoms were built up of hydrogen atoms (see 1815), chemists had been checking the atomic weights of various elements with greater and greater accuracy. The fact that so many atomic weights were not multiples of hydrogen's seemed to disprove Prout's hypothesis. Twelve years before, for instance, the British physicist John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919), had shown that the atomic weight of oxygen, although usually considered to be 16 times the atomic weight of hydrogen, is actually 15.882 times the atomic weight of hydrogen. Rayleigh went on to measure the atomic weight of nitrogen and then encountered a puzzle. Whereas oxygen always had the same atomic weight no matter how it was prepared, nitrogen did not. Nitrogen prepared from the atmosphere consistently showed a slightly higher atomic weight than nitrogen prepared from a variety of nitrogen-containing compounds. Rayleigh could not find a suitable explanation for this and wrote a letter to the journal Nature, asking for suggestions. The British chemist William Ramsay (1852-1916) rose to the challenge. He remembered having read that Cavendish (see 1766) had tried to combine the nitrogen of air with oxygen and had found that a small bubble of gas remained behind, which would simply not combine with oxygen. Cavendish Ramsay repeated the experiment and found himself with a small bubble of gas left over. He studied the spectral lines it emitted and found them to be in positions that fitted no known element. This gaseous element made up about 1 percent of the atmosphere and was completely inert, not reacting with any substance. It was named argon, which means 'inert.	
x-rays	1895	X-rays	X-rays were discovered unintentionally while working with cathode-ray tubes, leading to the observation of radiation penetrating matter. The discovery spurred significant interest and further research on electromagnetic radiation.	Wilhelm Röntgen	Germany	canal-rays	Science: Physics	On November 5, 1895, he set his cathode-ray tube to working, and in the dimness, a flash of light that did not come from the tube caught his eye. A sheet of paper coated with barium platinocyanide (one of the chemicals he was planning to use) was glowing. The glow ceased when the cathode-ray tube was turned off. The coated paper glowed even in the next room once the cathode-ray tube was turned on. Radiation was clearly emerging from the tube when the cathode rays were streaming, and was penetrating matter to some extent Röntgen didn't know what the radiation might be, so he referred to it as X rays, X being the usual symbol for an unknown quantity in mathematics. He published his findings on December 18, 1895.	
cathode-ray-particles	1895	Cathode ray particles	It was demonstrated that cathode rays are streams of negatively charged particles and not waves, leading to a better understanding of their nature. This discovery was crucial in confirming the particle nature of cathode rays.	Jean-Baptiste Perrin	France	x-rays	Science: Physics	In 1895, however, a French physicist, Jean-Baptist Perrin (1870-1942), showed that when cathode rays were made to impinge upon a cylinder, the cylinder gradually gained a large negative charge. That finally settled the matter. Cathode rays were streams of negatively-charged particles, and no one has doubted it since.	
velocity-and-mass	1895	Velocity and mass	Research indicated that mass increases with velocity, posing that at the speed of light, mass becomes infinite, implying the speed of light as an absolute maximum. This theory contributed significantly to the understanding of the relationship between velocity and mass.	Hendrik Antoon Lorentz	Netherlands	fitzgerald-contraction, michelson-morley-experiment	Science: Physics	The negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment (see 1887) still attracted the attention of physicists. The Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853-1928) came to the same conclusions that FitzGerald had come to concerning the shortening of distance with speed (see 1892) but went farther. It seemed to Lorentz that mass would have to increase with velocity and do so at a steadily increasing rate. At a speed of 160,000 miles per second, the mass of any object should have doubled, and at the speed of light (a little over 186,000 miles per second), it should become infinite. This idea made the speed of light appear to be an absolute maximum. As a result of Lorentz’s work,	
helium-on-earth	1895	Helium on earth	Helium was identified on Earth after being previously detected only in solar observations. Ramsey extracted it out of a uranium mineral. Like argon, this element didn't quite fit into the existing periodic table.	William Ramsay	Scotland	periodic-table-of-the-elements, argon	Science: Chemistry	Argon, discovered the year before by Rayleigh and Ramsay (see 1894), did not fit in with any existing family, but it seemed to be in the neighborhood of chlorine and potassium as far as its atomic weight was concerned. Since the periodic table was based largely on valence (see 1852), it made sense to put argon between chlorine and potassium. Chlorine and potassium each had a valence of 1, and since argon formed no combinations with other atoms at all, it had to have a valence of 0. The valence progression of 1, 0, 1 made sense, and argon would be the first member of a new family of elements of 0 valence. In that case, where were the others? Ramsay made it his business to look for them. In 1895 he learned that in America, samples of a gas taken for nitrogen had been obtained from a uranium mineral. That looked hopeful, for the 0-valence gases could be mistaken for the rather inert nitrogen but for no other gas. Ramsay repeated the work with a uranium mineral and got a gas that resembled nitrogen in its inertness. He tested the gas spectroscopically, however, and it did not produce the spectral lines of nitrogen. Instead it produced the spectral lines that Ramsay recognized as those detected by Janssen in sunlight (see 1868). Janssen’s solar element had been named helium, and now Ramsay had identified it on Earth, and found that it would lie between hydrogen and lithium in the periodic table. As to what helium might be doing in the uranium mineral, that was a puzzle, but the answer was not long in coming.	
curie-temperature	1895	Curie temperature	It was discovered that magnetism in ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, disappears at a specific temperature, known as the Curie temperature. This temperature varies for different metals, with iron losing its magnetism at 770°C.	Pierre Curie	France	electromagnetism	Science: Physics	People must have noticed that if a magnet was made red hot it would lose its magnetism. Curie (see 1880) showed that this was not a gradual effect. There was a specific temperature (now called the Curie temperature) at which the magnetism of iron disappeared. This happens to be 770° C. Other metals that have the same strong response to magnetism that iron does (and are therefore said to be ferromagnetic, from the Latin word for 'iron') also have Curie temperatures. For nickel it is 358° C, and for cobalt, 1131° C.	
radio-antennas	1895	Radio antennas	With a new detector, Branly could detect radio waves 150 yards from the source. Lodge improved it and demonstrated sending and receiving morse code, and then Popov and Marconi added antennas to strengthen the signal.	Edouard-Eugène Branly and others	France and others	radio-waves	Science: Physics	Once Hertz had demonstrated the existence of radio waves (see 1888), the possibility of using such waves in signaling across long distances occurred to a number of people. If one could use such radiation for the purpose, one could do away with total dependence on telegraph wires and cables. Indeed, the British call communications by radio waves wireless telegraphy or for short wireless. Americans call it radiotelegraphy or for short radio. Of course, to make such communication possible, one needs a far better detector than the simple loop Hertz used. In 1890 a French physicist, Edouard-Eugène Branly (1844-1940), invented a detector that consisted of a container of loosely packed metal filings. It ordinarily conducted little current, but it conducted quite a bit when radio waves fell upon	
uranium-radiations	1896	Uranium radiations	While studying the fluorescent substance potassium uranyl sulfate, Becquerel thought sunlight would make the crystal fluoresce and emit x-rays. He accidentally found that no sunlight was needed, and that the crystal was radiating x-rays on its own.	Antoine-Henri Becquerel	France	x-rays, dry-plates	Science: Physics	The discovery of X rays by Röntgen (see 1895) fascinated a French physicist, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908), who had been working on fluorescent substances as his father had before him. He wondered if perhaps the radiation given off by fluorescent substances might include X rays. A fluorescent substance both he and his father had	
dietary-deficiency-diseases	1896	Dietary deficiency diseases	Eijkman discovered that beriberi was a dietary deficiency disease caused by the absence of a substance found in the hulls of unpolished rice. This discovery was significant as it corrected the previous assumption that beriberi was a germ disease.	Christiaan Eijkman	Netherlands	scurvy, germ-theory-of-disease	Science: Medicine	People in the Dutch East Indies commonly suffered from beriberi, which produced weakness and death. Naturally it was assumed to be a germ disease, since Pasteur (see 1862) and others had been so successful at combating disease on that assumption. However, no one could find the germ that caused the disease. A Dutch physician, Christiaan Eijkman (1858-1930), who had gone to the East Indies to study the disease, was nonplussed. But then an ailment broke out in 1896 among the chickens being used at the laboratory for bacteriological researches. The chicken polyneuritis showed symptoms similar to beriberi, and Eijkman was busily studying the disease and checking on its contagiousness—when it suddenly disappeared and all the chickens got well. Eijkman investigated and found that during the period when the chickens had had the disease, they had been feeding on rice ordinarily meant for the human patients. The disease disappeared when a new cook put them back on commercial chicken feed. Eijkman found he could produce the chicken disease at will when he fed the chickens polished rice. By feeding them unpolished rice, he cured them. Eijkman was the first to correct a specific disease by diet since Lind had connected citrus fruits and scurvy (see 1747). Although Eijkman missed the point at first, it became clear that beriberi was a dietary deficiency disease. It was caused by the absence of some substance (present in the hulls of unpolished rice and not present in polished rice from which the hulls had been removed) that seemed necessary to health in small traces. For this discovery, Eijkman received a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1929.	
light-and-magnetism	1896	Light and magnetism	Maxwell thought that light was electromagnetic radiation, but whatever charge doing the oscillating had yet to be found. Lorentz and his student Zeeman suggested there might be electric charges within the atom, and found them by placing a strong magnetic field near an atom, confirming their spectral lines had changed. 	Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman	Netherlands	ionic-dissociation, radio-waves, maxwells-equations	Science: Physics		
ferments-and-enzymes	1896	Ferments and enzymes	Discovered that enzymes from yeast could function outside of the living cells, successfully fermenting sugar. From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen	Eduard Buchner	Germany	enzyme, mesmerism	Science: Chemistry, Biology	In 1896 a German chemist, Eduard Buchner (1860–1917), wondered if the enzymes in yeast would work if they were extracted from the living cell. To do this, he ground up yeast cells with sand until not one of them was left alive. He then filtered the material, obtaining a clear, cell-free liquid. He added sugar to preserve it against bacterial contamination and found that before long carbon dioxide was forming vigorously. The clear extract from the yeast was doing the job of fermenting sugar just as the intact cells would have, and Buchner had demonstrated the opposite of what he had expected. From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen. For this work, Buchner was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1907. From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen.	
acoustics	1896	Acoustics	Studied and solved the issue of sound clarity in a new lecture room with excessive reverberation. This led to the foundation of architectural acoustics and methods for designing auditoriums with clear sound.	Wallace Clement Ware Sabine	United States	mach-number, phonograph	Science: Physics	In 1896 an American physicist, Wallace Clement Ware Sabine (1868–1919), completed the study of a new lecture room that had been built at Harvard University the previous year. The lecture room had a flaw; the lecturer could not be heard because of excessive reverberation. Sabine had investigated every angle of the problem, even photographing sound waves that were made visible by the changes in light refraction they produced. As a result of his studies, Sabine founded the science of architectural acoustics. In the process he showed how to design a hall that would make the sounds of voice and music clear. For the purpose, he made use of mathematical equations that related absorptivity of sound by various materials and the volume of the room to the amount of reverberation.	
electron-as-subatomic-particle	1897	Electron as subatomic particle	Demonstrated that cathode rays are made of negatively charged particles which could be deflected by an electric field. This was the first discovery of a subatomic particle, smaller than an atom.	Joseph John Thomson	England	cathode-ray-particles, laws-of-electrolysis, fundamental-unit-of-electricity	Science: Physics	By now Perrin's work had convinced everyone that cathode rays consisted of negatively charged particles (see 1895). The last bit of evidence was supplied by the British physicist Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940), who showed that cathode rays could be deflected not only by a magnet but by an electric field. From the amount of the deflection, Thomson could work out the ratio of the electric charge of the cathode ray particle to its mass. This ratio turned out to be quite high, so that either the charge was high or the mass was low or both. Thomson supposed that the charge would be the unit charge worked out from Faraday's laws of electrolysis (see 1832). If so, the mass of the cathode ray particle would be only a small fraction of the hydrogen atom's, the smallest atom known. (We now know that the particle has a mass only 1/1837 of hydrogen's.) Thomson called the particle the electron, making use of Stoney's suggested name for the fundamental unit of electric charge (see 1891), since he suspected that the particle carried that fundamental unit. And to be sure, no smaller electric charge has actually been observed since then. The electron was the first subatomic particle (particle smaller than an atom) to be discovered.	
uranium-radiation-quantified	1897	Uranium radiation quantified	Used piezoelectricity to measure the intensity of radiation given off by uranium compounds. She found that the intensity was proportional to the amount of uranium, suggesting that radiation comes directly from the uranium atom, not the compound.	Marie Sklodowska Curie	France	piezoelectricity, uranium-radiations	Science: Physics		
alpha-rays-and-beta-rays	1897	Alpha rays and beta rays	Discovered two types of radiation emitted by uranium, which he named alpha rays and beta rays. Alpha rays are positively charged and more massive than beta rays, which are negatively charged.	Ernest Rutherford	England	uranium-radiations	Science: Physics	The radiations given off by uranium were of more than one kind. Some were deflected only slightly in a direction that indicated them to be positively charged. Some were deflected much more sharply in the opposite direction and were therefore negatively charged. Both had to consist of streams of particles, and the particles of the former were clearly the more massive.	
nickel-as-catalyst	1897	Nickel as catalyst	Found that powdered nickel could act as a catalyst to convert ethylene to ethane, which helped in creating edible fats from inedible plant oils. Nickel was much cheaper than platnium which had previous been used for this purpose.	Paul Sabatier	France	platinum-as-catalyst	Science: Chemistry	The metal nickel combines with carbon monoxide to form a compound that is liquid at ordinary temperatures and boils at 43°C. In 1897 the French chemist Paul Sabatier (1854–1941) wondered if other volatile nickel compounds could be formed by combining the metal with other gases. He chose ethylene for his attempt, since like carbon monoxide, it has a double bond. He failed, but found that some of the ethylene had, in the presence of nickel, changed to ethane. The double bond in ethylene had thus added two hydrogen atoms. That happens easily if a metal such as powdered platinum is used as a catalyst. Sabatier had now shown that powdered nickel, which was much cheaper, would do the same. Sabatier went on to perfect the technique, and nickel catalysis went on eventually to make possible the formation of edible fats, such as margarine and shortenings, from inedible plant oils, such as cotton-seed oil. For this work Sabatier was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1912.	
mosquitoes-and-malaria	1897	Mosquitoes and malaria	Ronald Ross discovered the malarial parasite in the anopheles mosquito, highlighting mosquitoes as disease vectors. This finding paved the way for malaria prevention by targeting mosquito breeding sites and using mosquito netting.	Ronald Ross	England	cattle-fever, malaria	Science: Medicine	Smith’s discovery of the manner in which ticks served to communicate disease (see 1893) turned the minds of pathologists in the direction of sighting insects as possible disease-spreaders. The British physician Ronald Ross (1857–1932) devoted himself to collecting, feeding, and dissecting mosquitoes until in 1897 he discovered the malarial parasite that had been identified by Laveran (see 1880) in the anopheles mosquito. This meant that malaria might well be fought by wiping out the breeding places of these mosquitoes, by making use of mosquito netting, and so on. For this, Ross received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1902.	
oscilloscope	1897	Oscilloscope	The oscilloscope was created by modifying the cathode-ray tube to display oscillations caused by varying electromagnetic fields. It laid the groundwork for modern television screens.	Karl Ferdinand Braun	Germany	cathode-rays	Science: Physics	In 1897 a German physicist, Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850–1918), modified the cathode-ray tube in such a way that the spot of green fluorescence formed by the stream of speeding particles shifted in accordance with the electromagnetic field set up by a varying current. The device was called an oscilloscope, because the spot could follow and reveal the oscillations of the field. Braun's device was the ancestor of the present-day television screen.	
large-refracting-telescope	1897	Large refracting telescope	A large refracting telescope with a 40-inch lens was constructed, reaching the limits of the arts. It was the largest of its kind and marked the limits of refracting telescopes.	Clark	England	telescope	Space	In 1897 Clark, the discoverer of Sirius's dim companion (see 1844), supervised the construction of a refracting telescope with a lens 40 inches across. It was the largest and best refractor built up to that time, but it had reached the limits of the art. No larger refractor has been built since then, or is likely to be built. All larger telescopes are of the reflecting variety that Newton invented (see 1668).	
diesel-engine	1897	Diesel engine	The diesel engine was perfected to ignite fuel through heat generated by compression, allowing for the use of safer, higher-boiling fuels. Its design enabled its use in heavy transport vehicles.	Rudolf Diesel	Germany	gas-laws, high-pressure, four-stroke-engine	Science: Engineering	The four-stroke engine invented by Otto (see 1876) used low-boiling gasoline for fuel and ignited the vapor-air mixture with an electric spark. A German inventor, Rudolf Diesel (1858–1913), tried to eliminate the complexities that resulted from running an electrical system in conjunction with an engine. By 1897 he had perfected a Diesel engine that ignited the vapor-air mixture by the heat developed through compression. This allowed him to use higher-boiling fuel such as kerosene, which was cheaper and less inflammable (hence safer) than gasoline. However, the compression had to be great, so the Diesel engine had to be considerably larger and heavier than the Otto engine if the higher pressures were to be brought about and maintained. Diesel engines therefore found their use in heavy transport vehicles such as trucks, buses, locomotives, and ships.	
polonium-and-radium	1898	Polonium and radium	Polonium and radium were discovered, demonstrating intense radioactivity. Thorium too was recognized as radioactive.This led to the coining of the term 'radioactivity' and awards for the Curies.	Marie and Pierre Curie	France	uranium-radiation-quantified, thorium	Science: Chemistry	Marie and Pierre Curie continued to work on the radiations produced by uranium and other heavy metals. In 1898 Marie Curie showed that thorium produced radiations and coined the term radioactivity. They discovered polonium and radium, which were intensely radioactive.	
neon-krypton-xenon	1898	Neon, krypton, and xenon	Krypton, neon, and xenon were discovered as new zero-valent noble gases. The discovery added to the understanding of the newly discovered noble (or inert) gas group which came to include argon and helium.	William Ramsay and Morris William Travers	England	argon, helium	Science: Chemistry	Polonium and radium were not the only elements discovered in 1898. William Ramsay discovered krypton, neon, and xenon with the help of Morris William Travers. These were part of the zero-valence and noble gases.	
liquid-hydrogen	1898	Liquid hydrogen	A new technique enabled the production of liquid hydrogen at very low temperatures. This was a significant advancement in gas liquefaction processes. However Helium remained a gas even at 20°K.	Carl von Linde	Germany	liquid-oxygen	Science: Chemistry	Carl von Linde developed a technique for cooling gases in stages, making it possible to produce commercial quantities of liquid air. James Dewar improved Linde's system and successfully liquefied hydrogen at only 20°K in 1898.	
phoebe	1898	Phoebe	A ninth satellite of Saturn, named Phoebe, was discovered. It orbits far from Saturn in a retrograde direction (clockwise rather than counterclockwise as seen above Saturn's north pole), suggesting it may be a captured asteroid.	William Henry Pickering	United States	saturn-satellites	Space	In 1898 the American astronomer William Henry Pickering (1858-1938) discovered a ninth satellite of Saturn, which he named Phoebe, after still another of the siblings of Saturn (Cronos) in the Greek myths. It was far more distant from Saturn than the satellites discovered earlier, and it revolved around the planet in a retrograde direction (clockwise rather than counterclockwise, if viewed from high above Saturn's north pole), so that it is considered to be a captured asteroid.	
eros	1898	Eros	Asteroid 433, named Eros, was discovered and it approaches Earth more closely than Mars or Venus. Its discovery led to the practice of naming asteroids with orbits extending outside the asteroid belt with masculine names.	Gustav Witt	Germany	asteroid-photography	Space	But then, on August 13, 1898, the German astronomer Gustav Witt discovered asteroid number 433. When its orbit was plotted, it proved to be a real stunner. At aphelion (when it is most distant from the Sun), it is well within the asteroid belt. At perihelion, however, it is only 105,000,000 miles from the Sun—well within the orbit of Mars. At its closest to the Earth, the two could be only a little over 14,000,000 miles apart. Since it approached Earth more closely than Mars or Venus did, Witt gave it the name of the child of Mars and Venus in the Greek myths—Eros. That began the habit of giving masculine names to asteroids whose orbits extend outside the asteroid belt.	
filtrable-virus	1898	Filtrable virus	Pasteur couldn't find the microorganism that caused rabies and suggested a smaller microorganism might be responsible. These viruses were identified: microorganisms smaller than bacteria capable of passing through filters that stop bacteria. This discovery laid the foundational principles for virology.	Martinus Willem Beijerinck	Netherlands	rabies	Science: Biology	In 1898 the Dutch botanist Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851-1931) did a similar experiment, but he had no hesitation in maintaining that there was a causative agent smaller than a bacterium, but capable of passing through a filter that could stop bacteria. He created the term 'virus' for such a filtrable causative agent. His term was quickly accepted, and he is generally considered the founder of virology as an independent branch of microbiology.	
mitochondria	1898	Mitochondria	Microscopes improved and it became clear that the cell had a complex structure. Mitochondria were identified as distinct structures within the cell's cytoplasm, initially named due to their thread-like appearance. This later revealed them to be crucial organelles with significant functions.	Carl Benda	Germany	cell-theory, chromatin	Science: Biology	As microscopes improved, it was clear that the cell did not consist of a homogeneous fluid but had a complex structure, even outside the nucleus. In 1898 the German histologist Carl Benda (1857–1933) made out tiny bodies in the cytoplasm. He called them mitochondria, from Greek words meaning “threads of cartilage,” which is what he thought they were. They turned out to be far more than that.	
epinephrine	1898	Epinephrine	Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, was studied and named after the discovery that deterioration of adrenal glands can cause Addison's disease. This became the first isolated hormone, despite the concept of hormones not being fully developed at the time.	John Jacob Abel	United States		Science: Biology	An American pharmacologist, John Jacob Abel (1857–1938), was able to study this substance in 1898, and he named it epinephrine (from Greek words meaning “above the kidney”). Three years later, a Japanese chemist, Jokichi Takamine (1854–1922), working in the United States, isolated the substance in pure, crystalline form. He called it adrenaline. Both names are still used. Actually epinephrine/adrenaline was the first hormone to be isolated, but the hormone concept had not yet been elaborated.	
submarine	1898	Submarine	Drebbel's attempt to make a submarine in 1620 required oars placed on the surface. The first sea-going submarine was built, marking the start of modern submarine technology. The Argonaut I successfully sailed fully submerged from Norfolk to New York.	Simon Lake	United States	ironclad-warships, high-pressure, four-stroke-engine	Design	Ships made to go under the water have been a human fancy for centuries, but the first to attempt to build one was a Dutch inventor, Cornelis Jacobszoon Drebbel (1572–1633), who piloted one in the Thames River between 1620 and 1624. An American inventor, David Bushnell (1742–1824), devised simple submarines that were used unsuccessfully against British ships in harbor during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. It was not till 1898, however, that an American mechanical engineer, Simon Lake (1866–1945), succeeded in devising a submarine that could actually go out to sea. In that year, his submarine Argonaut I sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to New York. This marked the true beginning of modern submarines.	
actinium	1899	Actinium	A new element, actinium, was isolated from uranium ores. It was named based on the Greek word for 'ray' and is equivalent to radium in Latin.	André-Louis Debierne	France	polonium-and-radium	Science: Chemistry	There was more in uranium ores than the polonium and radium that the Curies had detected (see 1898). In 1899 the French chemist André-Louis Debierne (1874–1949), a close friend of the Curies, isolated still another element from the ores. He called it actinium, from a Greek word for "ray," so that the name was the Greek equivalent of the Latin radium.	
logic-and-geometry	1899	Logic and geometry	"Foundations of Geometry" proposed a set of axioms for geometry, focusing on the properties of points, lines, and planes. The system proved to be self-consistent, which was crucial for its acceptance.	David Hilbert	Germany	axiomatics	Math	In 1899 the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862–1943) published Foundations of Geometry, in which he proposed a set of axioms for geometry that was the most satisfactory yet. He began with points, lines, and planes as undefined concepts. It was not necessary to define them, merely to describe certain properties they possessed. He also used certain relationships, such as between, parallel, and continuous, without defining them. Again, provided the consequences of using those words were clearly set forth, it didn’t matter what they actually meant. Hilbert proved his system of axioms to be self-consistent, and that was crucial.	
solid-hydrogen	1899	Solid hydrogen	Solid hydrogen was produced, achieving the lowest temperature ever obtained at 14° K. At this temperature, helium still remained gaseous.	James Dewar	England	liquid-hydrogen	Science: Physics	Dewar, who had liquefied hydrogen the year before, took another step toward absolute zero by producing solid hydrogen in 1899. This brought the lowest temperature ever obtained down to 14° K. At this temperature, all known substances but one were solid. The only exception was helium, which even at this temperature remained gaseous.	
quanta	1900	Quanta	Planck developed an equation for black body radiation by hypothesizing that energy is emitted in discrete pieces called quanta. This discovery introduced the concept of energy quantization, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.	Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck	Germany	black-bodies, wavelengths-and-temperature	Science: Physics	Kirchnoff had pointed out that a black body (one that absorbed all electromagnetic radiation that fell on it) would radiate at all wavelengths if heated (see 1860). Thus, a hollow body with a small hole in it would absorb all the radiation that entered through the hole, for virtually none of it would be reflected and find its way out again. If such a body was heated, radiation would therefore emerge from the hole at all wavelengths, with very little at the extremes and with a peak at some intermediate value. The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength of the peak value. A number of physicists tried to work out mathematical equations for the distribution of wavelengths in such black body radiation. Rayleigh and Wien (see 1894) both advanced equations in 1900, but Rayleigh’s worked well only for the long-wavelength half, and Wien’s only for the short-wavelength half. Neither one could work out an equation that gave the distribution across the board. Then a German physicist, Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858-1947), produced an equation that did just that. In order to derive that equation, he had to assume that energy was given off not continuously but in discrete pieces, and that the size of the piece was inversely proportional to the wavelength. Thus, since violet light had half the wavelength of red light, violet light would be delivered in pieces that were twice the size, and therefore twice the energy content, of red light. Planck called the bits of energy quanta (singular, quantum, a Latin word meaning "how much?"). He worked out the relationship between energy and wavelength (or energy and frequency, since frequency is 1 divided by the wavelength), making use of a very small value called Planck’s constant, which represents the "graininess" of energy. Since Planck’s constant is exceedingly small, energy has a very fine grain indeed, and it is not noticeable except in special circumstances, so that the laws of thermodynamics could be deduced as though energy were a continuous fluid without grain. The problem of black body radiation was the first in which the graininess had to be taken into account. There was no evidence, at first, for the existence of quanta, except for the fact that it made the equation for black body radiation.	
mass-increase	1900	Mass increase	Lorentz's theory that mass increases with velocity was confirmed through observations of electrons moving at 90% of the speed of light. 	Hendrik Antoon Lorentz	Netherlands	velocity-and-mass, cathode-ray-particles	Science: Physics	Lorentz had maintained that mass increased with velocity (see 1895). It did not seem at the time that this could ever be checked, for the velocities needed to make the change in mass measurable were too huge to deal with in the laboratory. As physicists began to study the speeding electrons involved in cathode rays, and in other phenomena, however, it turned out that electrons might be moving at respectable fractions of the speed of light—up to 90 percent in some cases. This meant the mass increase ought to be measurable, since fast electrons, becoming more massive than slow ones, would bend less sharply in response to electromagnetic fields. This turned out to be so, and the increase in mass, measured in 1900 for the first time, matched quite closely the theoretical predictions of Lorentz. The Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction was borne out, but physicists had to wait five more years before a comprehensive physical theory that explained it was advanced.	
beta-particles	1900	Beta particles electrons	Becquerel determined that beta particles were actually electrons through his studies of uranium radiation. This finding linked electrons not just to electric currents but also to atomic structure, particularly in radioactive atoms.	Antoine-Henri Becquerel	France	alpha-rays-and-beta-rays, uranium-radiation-quantified	Science: Physics	Becquerel, who had discovered uranium radiations (see 1896) continued to study them. The beta rays were clearly composed of negatively charged beta particles, and from the way these curved in a magnetic field of a particular strength, they seemed to resemble electrons. In 1900, after a close study of the properties of beta particles, Becquerel decided that they were electrons. Until then, electrons had seemed to be associated only with electric currents, as in the case of cathode rays. Now it seemed they were associated with atoms as well—at least with radioactive atoms.	
gamma-rays	1900	Gamma rays	Paul Ulrich Villard discovered gamma rays while studying uranium radiation. These rays were even more pentrating than x-rays and characterized by their short wavelength, distinguishing them from alpha and beta rays.	Paul Ulrich Villard	France	alpha-rays-and-beta-rays, x-rays	Science: Physics	In 1900 the French physicist Paul Ulrich Villard (1860–1934), studying the radiations from uranium that Becquerel had discovered, noted that in addition to alpha rays and beta rays, there was some radiation that was totally unaffected by magnets. This, it was decided, consisted of electromagnetic radiation. Its properties were very much like those of X rays, but it was even more penetrating and therefore even shorter in wavelength. It came to be called gamma rays, after the third letter of the Greek alphabet.	
radon	1900	Radon	Friedrich Ernst Dorn discovered that radium emits a radioactive gas, later identified as the noble gas radon. This addition expanded the understanding of radioactive elements and noble gases.	Friedrich Ernst Dorn	Germany	polonium-and-radium	Science: Chemistry	A German physicist, Friedrich Ernst Dorn (1848–1916), studying the radium that Curie had discovered (see 1898), found in 1900 that it gave off not only radiations but a gas that was itself radioactive. The gas was called radium emanation at first, but on closer study it turned out to be a noble gas (see 1898), the sixth one, and was named radon.	
atomic-change	1900	Atomic change	Crookes discovered a method for treating uranium compounds in a way to make them much less radioactive. Uranium might not be radioactive after all. Becquerel suggested that this was due to a spontaneous change of one atom into another, the first suggestion of its kind.	William Crookes	England	uranium-radiation-quantified	Science: Chemistry	In 1900 Crookes (see 1861) found that it was possible to treat a solution of uranium compound in such a way that part of it would be removed as an insoluble material. The removed portion was an impurity, the uranium compound itself remaining in solution.	
electron-emission	1900	Electron emission	Heated metals were found to emit speeding electrons which carried electricity. This a phenomenon advanced electronic technology development.	Owen Willans Richardson	England	edison-effect	Science: Physics	Beginning in 1900, the British physicist Owen Willans Richardson (1879–1959) studied the phenomenon and realized that heated metals tended to emit speeding electrons, which carried the electricity. His observation made it possible to apply the Edison effect to the developing electronic technology. For his work, he received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1928.	
mutations	1900	Mutations	Research on the American evening primrose flower led to the discovery of visible changes in organisms, termed mutations. This concept advanced evolutionary theory by emphasizing broader changes in traits across generations.	Hugo Marie De Vries	Netherlands	genetics	Science: Biology	The American evening primrose had been introduced into the Netherlands in the 1880s, and in 1886 a Dutch botanist, Hugo Marie De Vries (1848–1935), came across a colony of them growing in a clump in a meadow. He could see that some were very different from others, even though it seemed likely that all had grown from a common batch of seeds. He dug them up, took them to his garden, and bred them separately and together. By 1900 he had evolved the laws of genetics that Mendel had worked out (see 1865). Unknown to De Vries and to each other, two other botanists were making the same rediscovery. One was a German, Karl Erich Correns (1864–1933), and the other an Austrian, Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg (1871–1962). Each of the three independently decided to publish his discovery, and each of the three found, on searching the literature, that he had been anticipated by Mendel. Each of the three (in a remarkable display of scientific ethics) reported Mendel as the discoverer and presented his own work merely as confirmation. De Vries, however, went beyond Mendel. He had observed that the primroses didn’t always breed true, that some characteristics appeared that didn’t seem to exist in earlier generations. He suggested, therefore, that evolution did not always proceed in small, nearly microscopic steps, but sometimes in changes large enough to be clearly visible. He called these visible changes mutations (from a Latin word for “change”), and indeed the concept of mutations now forms an integral and indispensable part of the theory of evolution.	
blood-types	1900	Blood types	Specific properties of human blood were demonstrated, classifying it into four types: O, A, B, and AB. Plasma of some types of blood introduced into some patients could clump red cells and block blood vessels, leading to death. This breakthrough significantly improved the safety and effectiveness of blood transfusions.	Karl Landsteiner	Austria	blood-color, microscope	Science: Medicine	An Austrian physician, Karl Landsteiner (1868-1943), was able to demonstrate some specific properties of human blood. Plasma (the liquid portion of blood) from one donor might clump red cells from person A but not from person B. Serum from another donor might clump red cells from person B but not from person A. Still other samples of plasma might clump both - or neither. Clumped red cells could block blood vessels and lead to death. Therefore, it was necessary in performing a blood transfusion to know that the blood of the donor would not clump the red cells of the receiver. Landsteiner showed that human blood fell into four classes: O, A, B, and AB. It was always safest if both donor and receiver were in the same class. In an emergency, O blood could be given to any receiver, but A blood could be given only to A and AB receivers, B blood only to B and AB receivers, and AB blood only to AB receivers. Landsteiner made blood transfusion rational and safe and added an important weapon to the medical armory. For this discovery, he received the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1930.	
yellow-fever	1900	Yellow fever	Yellow fever was a severe problem in coastal cities, with many deaths following outbreaks. Research in 1900 showed that it is transmitted by mosquitoes, leading to control efforts by targeting mosquito populations.	Walter Reed	United States	malaria	Science: Medicine	Yellow fever was a terrifying scourge of coastal cities. New York and Philadelphia, for instance, were periodically hit, and many deaths followed. The Spanish-American War made the United States particularly disease-conscious, as far more American soldiers died from disease and from tainted meat than died from enemy bullets. The American military surgeon Walter Reed (1851-1902) was sent to Cuba in 1899 to see if he could do something about yellow fever. He had already showed, in 1897, that it was not caused by a bacterium, as had been earlier proposed. His studies in Cuba showed that the disease was not transmitted by bodily contact, by clothing, or by bedding. He suspected mosquito carriers, as Ross had shown was the case with malaria (see 1897). The case was proved for yellow fever, too, in 1900, when doctors allowed mosquitoes to sting patients and then themselves. One doctor, Jesse William Lazear (1866-1900), died as a result. Yellow fever was brought under control by fighting mosquitoes and destroying their breeding grounds. The last yellow fever epidemic in the United States was in New Orleans in 1905.	
dreams	1900	Dreams	Dreams were historically interpreted as supernatural or spiritual events. Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams" gave them a scientific meaning, suggesting they reveal truths about our unconscious mind.	Sigmund Freud	Austria	unconscious-mind	Science: Psychology	Dreams had always mystified human beings. Dreaming that dead people were alive helped lead to a belief in the spirit world. Erotic dreams led to belief in incubi and succubi. Dreams seemed to be doorways into a different world, to be messages from the gods, to be revelations of events at a distance or in the future. All this was dismissed as superstition by rationalists, but Freud (see 1884) gave new meaning to dreams. In 1900 he published The Interpretation of Dreams. Dreams, he maintained, might represent truths about human beings that they were not willing to accept in their waking hours, so that psychoanalysis might be hastened and aided by: the study of dreams.	
tryptophan	1900	Tryptophan	By this point, thirteen different amino acids had been isolated. Tryptophan is an amino acid isolated from protein molecules broken down by the digestive enzyme trypsin. It plays a significant role in dietetics and food chemistry.	Frederick Gowland Hopkins	England	nucleic-acid, organic-synthesis	Science: Biology	By now, some thirteen different amino acids had been isolated, each of which were among the building blocks of protein molecules. Still another was isolated in 1900 by the British biochemist Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861-1947). He called it tryptophan, from Greek words meaning "appearing through trypsin," because he had obtained it from protein molecules that had been broken down by the digestive enzyme trypsin.	
free-radicals	1900	Free radicals	Gomberg experimented with compounds with unusual structure. First he studied the compound consisting of a carbon atom to four different benzene rings, then he failed to create one with two carbons hooked to six benzene rings which would always break apart. Such groupings became known as radicals.	Moses Gomberg	United States	organic-synthesis, benzene-ring	Science: Chemistry	Organic chemists find it interesting to try to synthesize compounds of unusual structure. The Russian-born American chemist Moses Gomberg (1866-1947) tried to attach a carbon atom to four different benzene rings. There is scarcely room around a single carbon atom for four such bulky groupings, and a number of chemists had tried and failed. Gomberg, however, succeeded in forming small quantities of his compound, called tetraphenylmethane.	
dirigible	1900	Dirigible	A balloon with a steam engine would be impractically heavy, but internal-combustion engine and propellers took flight, allowing controlled movement independent of wind. This invention marked the creation of the dirigible or zeppelin.	Ferdinand Adolf August Heinrich von Zeppelin	Germany	hot-air-balloon, four-stroke-engine, aerodynamics	Science: Aviation	On July 2, 1900, one of Zeppelin's cigar-shaped vessels rose into the air. Beneath it was a gondola bearing an internal-combustion engine and a propeller. For the first time, an aircraft was not at the mercy of the wind but could move in any direction at will. It was called a dirigible balloon; that is, "a balloon that could be directed." This was soon abbreviated to dirigible, and the device was also sometimes called a zeppelin after its inventor.	
knossos-excavation	1900	Knossos excavation	Archaeological excavations revealed that a complex civilization existed in Crete nearly two thousand years before the Trojan War. This discovery provided evidence of an advanced society that dominated parts of the Greek mainland and Aegean islands.	Arthur John Evans	England	troy	Geography: Archaeology	During classical times, Crete had lain outside the current of history and was little regarded. Yet Homer, describing the Trojan War, gave Crete an important role, and in the Greek myths, Crete, under its king Minos, was described as dominating Greece in early times. A British archaeologist, Arthur John Evans (1851–1941), felt there might be some historical fact in that myth and, beginning in 1894, he engaged in archaeological excavations in Greece. By 1900 he had dug up the site of Knossos, the capital of Crete in Minos's legendary time. (Evans called it the Minoan civilization after the king.) He showed that a complex and advanced civilization had indeed existed for nearly two thousand years before the Trojan War, and that it had indeed dominated the islands of the Aegean and parts of the Greek mainland for a long period.
