calculating-machines	1693	Calculating machines	Built the Step Reckoner, a mechanical aid to calculation of trig and astronomical tables.	Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz	Germany	adding-machine	Math		
mortality-tables	1693	Mortality tables	He produced a life table showing the number of people surviving to any age from a cohort born the same year	Edmond Halley	England	probability	Math		
miners-friend	1698	Miner's friend	Miner's Friend invented to pump water out of flooded mines. Steam-powered air pump to help English coal mining, which was increasingly relied upon because of shortage of wood.	Thomas Savery	England	air-pump, coal-mining	Science		
scientific-voyages	1698	Scientific ocean voyages	First ocean voyage exclusively for science. Prior, voyages were taken for exploration, settlement or trade, with science as a side-effect. Halley's voyage measured magnetic declinations around the world, prepared first map of the world showing isodeclination, and accurate lat/long for ports.	Edmond Halley	England	india-water-route	Science		
gas-volume-temperature	1699	Gas volume temperature	Discovery that volume of gas proportional to temperature. A step towards gas laws, but not quite precise enough measurements yet.	Guillaume Amontons	France	air-pressure	Science		
binary-system	1700	Binary system	First use of non-decimal bases (2, 8, 12). A binary number is a number expressed in base 2, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1.	Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz	Germany	decimal-notation	Math		
comet-orbits	1705	Comets' Orbits	Comet orbits remained mysterious. Halley claimed that comet orbits were elliptical, just very elongated. At the time, he was not taken seriously, but when he successfully predicted the return of a comet 50 years later, he was vindicated posthumously.	Edmund Halley	England	comet-distance,laws-motion	Space		
plant-nourishment	1705	Plant Nourishment	Discovery that air contributed to the nourishment of plants, not just water. Also the first to collect gas by bubbling them through water and trapping in an inverted vessel.	Stephen Hales	England	gas	Science:Chemistry		
carriage-springs	1706	Carriage springs	Up to now, passengers of all wheeled vehicles were jolted by every road imperfection. Springs helped to absorb some of them, at the expense of swaying.			paved-road,steel	Culture		
static-electricity-improved	1706	Improved static generator	Greatly improved upon Guericke's static electricity generator by constructing a glass sphere turned by a crank that used friction to generate electricity. Led to more experiments with static electricity.	Francis Hauksbee	England	static-electricity	Science:Physics		
pulse-watch	1707	Pulse watch	By now clocks could tell time to the nearest minute, so minute hands were added to clocks in the late 17th century. Floyer invented a device which when wound would run for exactly 60 seconds. This allowed to calculate heart rate for the first time!	John Floyer	England	pendulum-clock, hand-watch	Science:Biology		
coke-iron	1709	Coke and iron	Iron smelting required high temperatures previously only attainable by burning coal. But coal was becoming increasingly expensive as English forests continued to recede. Coke turns out to be even more effective for smelting iron and could be done at higher temperatures and larger scale.	Abraham Darby	England	mineralogy, steel	Science		
rifle	1710	Rifle	If a gun barrel is outfitted with spiral grooves ("rifled"), the bullet will spin around its axis and aim better, but this requires better gun construction. The new Pennsylvania rifle took twice as long to reload but had triple the range.		America	musket	War		
newcomen-steam-engine	1712	Newcomen steam engine	The demand for coal was increasing, so were coal mining operations, and the need to pump water out of mines. Newcomen invented a new type of steam engine that could use lower pressure steam and was safer than Savery's Miner's Friend. Still very inefficient.	Thomas Newcomen	England	coke-iron,miners-friend	General		
smallpox-vaccine	1713	Smallpox inoculation	Smallpox was highly contagious and deadly, and left survivors disfigured with pockmarks. But the disease didn't recur in the same person. In Turkey, some began deliberately spreading mild cases of the disease through pus, but this was fraught.	Mary Wortley Montagu	England	epilepsy	Science:Biology		
mercury-thermometer	1714	Mercury thermometer	Ferdinand II de Medici was first to invent a closed thermometer (immune from effects of pressure), but used water or alcohol which didn't expand evenly with temperature. Fahrenheit made the switch to Mercury to remedy this. The scale is named after him, which starts at 0 because it was the coldest temperature he could create.	Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit	Germany	gas-volume-temperature,thermometer	Science:Physics		
solar-eclipse	1715	Solar eclipse	23 centuries prior, Thales predicted the eclipse which happened on April 22, 1715. Halley plotted the path of the eclipse and organized a number of observers to watch the eclipse.	Edmond Halley	England	eclipse, reflecting-telescope	Space		
stellar-motion	1718	Stellar motion	Up to now, it had been assumed that the stars were fixed in the sky. However, upon careful observation of bright stars Sirius, Procyon, and Arcturus, Halley found that they'd moved relative to the observations of Tycho.	Edmond Halley	England	supernova	Space		
easter-island	1722	Easter Island	Just 45 square miles in area, and 1200 miles from nearest land (a small island), likely the farthest point reached by the Polynesians. Roggeveen also discovered the Samoan Islands.	Jacob Roggeveen	Netherlands	around-earth	Geography		
longitude	1728	Ship’s chronometer	A ship's latitude (declination from equator) can be determined from the position of the sun or north star. But to measure longitude, you need to know time. Pendulums clocks don't work on swaying ships. Spurred by a large prize from the British government, Harrison built highly accurate sea clocks.	John Harrison	England	pendulum-clock,ocean-navigation	General		
aberration-light	1728	Aberration of light	Since heliocentricity, astronomers tried to see parallax in the stars as a result of the earth moving around the sun (186 million miles displacement). Rather than finding this parallax, Bradley ooked through a 212ft long telescope and found he had to tip the scope to catch the light as the earth moved, and unlocked a new way to calculate the speed of light.	James Bradley	England	comet-distance, speed-of-light	Science:Physics		
bering-strait	1728	Bering Strait	Peter I commissioned Bering, a Dutch navigator to explore far reaches of eastern Russia. He first mapped Kamchatka and then sailed north and reached the arctic ice without sighting land, continuing through the Bering Strait. This was definitive proof that North America was not part of Asia.	Vitus Jonassen Bering	Russia	new-world	Geography		
dentistry	1728	Dentistry	The first book entirely devoted to Dentistry was "Le chirurgien dentiste", discussing artificial dentures, crowns, how to treat cavities with metal fillings. Fauchard is considered the father of dentistry.	Pierre Fauchard	France	anatomy	Science:Biology		
electrical-conductance	1729	Electrical conductance	When he electrified a long glass tube, corks on both ends were electrified despite not having been touched. He tried this with other mediums, like 800ft long twine, and found that "electrical fluid" traveled through some mediums (conductors) better than others (insulators).	Stephen Gray	England	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics		
achromatic-lens	1733	Achromatic lens	Different kinds of glass produce spectra of different widths. Flint glass (contains lead) produced wider spectrum than crown (regular) glass. By combining a convex lens out of crown, and a concave lens out of flint glass, he made a lens that magnified without producing colors.	Chester Moor Hall	England	light-spectrum, concave-lenses	Science:Physics		
blood-pressure	1733	Blood pressure	Hales went from studying the flow of sap in plants to the flow of blood in animals, measuring rates of flow in different parts of the circulatory system. He wrote Hemostaticks in 1733.	Stephen Hales	England	plant-nourishment	Science:Biology		
positive-negative-charge	1733	Positive and negative charge	While studying static electricity, du Fay found that if you electrify two objects using different means (one by glass rod -- "vitreous", one by resin rod -- "resinous"), you can have them attract one another. He suggested two different kinds of electrical fluids.	Charles-Francois de Cisternay du Fay	France	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics		
flying-shuttle	1733	Flying shuttle	In weaving, a shuttle with yarn (weft) criss-crosses stationary yarn (warp), forming a lattice. Kay invented the flying shuttle, which enabled the weaver to pull the shuttle by means of two cords, greatly accelerating the process.	John Kay	England	laws-motion	Science:Physics		
shape-of-earth-confirmed	1735	Shape of the Earth	If the earth was the shape Newton suggested it was, a degree of latitude near the poles should be greater in mileage than at the equator. One explorer went to the equator (Peru), the other to the north pole (Lapland), confirming Newton. Sea level at equator is 13 miles farther from center than sea level at poles.	Charles Marie de la Condamine / Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis	France	shape-of-earth	Geography		
taxonomy	1735	Taxonomy	Linnaeus traveled over 4600 miles through northern Scandinavia, discovering hundreds of new plant species. He referred to each plant by genus and species (eg. Homo sapiens), the binomial nomenclature we still use today. And invented the taxonomy of classes, orders.	Carl von Linne	Sweden	plant-species-classified	Science:Biology		
trade-winds	1735	Trade winds	Hadley found that air near the equator had a faster west-to-east motion than air farther from it. This is due to the uneven heating of the earth due to the sun: hotter at the equator, cooler at poles, and the coriolis effect. Today this model is called the Hadley cell.	George Hadley	England	meteorological-map	Science:Physics		
mechanics	1736	Mechanics	Newton's principia featured geometric proofs of his claims. Euler wrote "Mechanics", and provided proofs using algebra and calculus.	Leonhard Euler	Switzerland	laws-motion	Science:Physics		
cobalt	1737	Cobalt	Miners were puzzled at some varieties of copper ore which didn't yield copper when smelted, and suspected foul play from kobolds, a type of mythical sprite. Upon closer examination, it was a new element (after Phosphorus), and Brandt named it cobalt. This was the first metal to be discovered not known to the medeival alchemists.	Georg Brandt	Sweden	phosphorus	Science:Chemistry		
kinetic-gases	1738	Kinetic theory of gases	Bernoulli modeled gas as many small particles in rapid movement, with temperature increasing their speed. As a result, increasing temperature increases volume (keeping pressure the same). Similarly, increasing temperature increases pressure if volume is kept fixed.	Daniel Bernoulli	Switzerland	boyles-law	Science:Physics		
rocky-mountains	1739	Rocky Mountains	The French continued their exploration of North America, with brother Pierre and Paul Mallet reaching Colorado and becoming the first Europeans to see the Rockies.	Pierre and Paul Mallet	France	america	Geography		
hydra	1740	Hydra	Trembley discovered the hydra, a small primitive organism resembling a plant, but actually an animal. It's tiny tentacles resembled the formidable Hydra destroyed by Hercules. And this hydra could regenerate parts that were cut off, as well as merge with other hydras to become one organism.	Abraham Trembley	Switzerland	plant-species-classified, animal-classification-improved	Science:Biology		
celsius	1742	Celsius scale	The Fahrenheit scale was commonly used, but phase changes were set at awkward quantities: melting at 32 F and boiling at 212 F. Celsius rationalized this by setting them to 0 and 100 respectively.	Anders Celsius	Sweden	mercury-thermometer	Science:Physics		
goldbach	1742	Goldbach’s conjecture	Working in Russia, German mathematician formulated a conjecture, still unproven: "Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."	Christian Goldbach	Russia	arab-numbers	Math		
franklin-stove	1742	Franklin stove	Fires in confined areas cause a lot of smoke, and chimneys allow hot air from the fire to escape immediately. Rather than creating a draft, Franklin devised a stove that would heat up the metal of the stove and let the air escape much more slowly. Initially it sold poorly, but David Rittenhouse made significant improvements.	Benjamin Franklin	America	fire,boyles-law	General		
transcendental-numbers	1744	Transcendental numbers	In mathematics, a transcendental number is a complex number that is not an algebraic number—that is, not a root (i.e., solution) of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. The best-known transcendental numbers are π and e.	Leonhard Euler	Switzerland	imaginary-numbers	Math		
leyden-jar	1745	Leyden jar	A Leyden jar stores a high-voltage electric charge (from an external source) between electrical conductors on the inside and outside of a glass jar. This was an improvement over Hauksbee's glass sphere, and gave its inventor a major shock. The same device was independently invented by a German physicist von Kleist. Named after the inventor's University of Leiden.	Peter van Musschenbroek	Netherlands	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics		
blood-and-iron	1745	Blood and iron	The chemical composition of blood was completely unknown until an experimenter fed iron to dogs to see if the iron would be incorporated in the blood. As a control, he checked the composition of regular dog blood and found that it already contained iron, specifically in red blood cells.	Vincenzo Menghini	Italy	red-blood-cells	Science:Biology		
scurvy	1747	Scurvy	More men were disabled by scurvy on long sea voyages than by any other cause. Lind served in the navy and knew how monotonous the diet was, and also knew that scurvy also appeared in other such environments (prisons, under siege). He studied the effect of fruits on scurvy and found citrus provided great relief.	James Lind	England	india-water-route	Science:Biology		
osmosis	1748	Osmosis	Intuitively, if a liquid can soak through a solid, it should be able to seep through in any direction. Nollet found that you can have semipermeable membranes that allow one type of liquid but not another. Thus enables unidirectional fluid flow.	Jean Antoine Nollet	France	hydrostatics	Science:Physics		
platinum	1749	Platinum	Existence of platnium was generally unknown since it is as rare as gold, but lacks its ostentatious beauty. It was scientifically studied by Ulloa, who found it to be denser than gold, higher melting and less reactive.	Antonio de Ulloa	Spain	steel	Science:Chemistry		
biological-evolution	1749	Biological evolution	Buffon was the first to speculate openly about evolution in a book called "Natural History", where he imagined an evolution in reverse: apes as degenerate humans, donkeys as degenerate horses, jackals as degenerate wolves. He was wrong, but it implied that species could change over time.	Louis Leclerc de Buffon	France	taxonomy	Science:Biology		
formation-earth	1749	Formation of the Earth	Buffon thought that there may have been a natural (not God) cause to Earth's creation, such as the collision of the Sun with a comet. He also estimated Earth's age by calculating how long it would take an Earth-sized object to cool from the temperature of the sun. His estimates of 75,000 years were wrong, but this was much greater than 6000.	Louis Leclerc de Buffon	France	comet-distance,biblical-age-of-earth	Space		
nickel	1751	Nickel	Cronstedt studied under Brandt, who isolated cobalt, and isolated another metal from ore that was neither copper nor cobalt. Colloquially known as kupfernickel by miners, he dubbed it nickel for short. Turned out nickel was also magnetic but weaker than iron.	Axel Fredrick Cronstedt	Sweden	cobalt	Science:Chemistry		
encyclopedia	1751	Encyclopedia	Diderot compiled a multivolume summary of all knowledge for the general public, with alphabetical entries. This was fitting at a time that called itself the Age of Reason.	Denis Diderot	France	printing-press	General		
lightning-rod	1752	Lightning rod	Franklin coined the terms "positive" and "negative" charge, rejecting du Fay's notion of two kinds of electrical fluids. He imagined that during a lightning strike, the earth and sky form a gigantic Leyden jar and flew a kite in a thunderstorm and found that the silk thread showed signs of electrical charge. He was also able to charge a real Leyden jar using this energy, proving that the two electricities were identical. Franklin generalized this idea and built tall metal spires on top of buildings, which averted lightning-induced fires, the first mitigation of natural disaster through science.	Benjamin Franklin	America	leyden-jar,positive-negative-charge	Science:Physics		
digestion	1752	Digestion	Up to now, there was debate whether digestion was chemical or mechanical in nature. In an experiment on hawks and dogs, Reaumur showed that it had to be both. Thus in addition to behaving like a mechanical machine, the body also has a chemical aspect.	Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur	France	muscles-bones, metabolism	Science:Biology		
earth-heat	1752	Earth and heat	Most Europeans up to now attributed changes to the Earth's surface to forces of water (called Neptunists). However Guettard challenged this after observing that rocks experienced great changes in temperature in the past.	Etienne Guettard	France	water-element,formation-earth	Science:Geology		
carbon-dioxide	1754	Carbon dioxide	Up to now, carbon dioxide had only been detected as a product of combustion or fermentation. Black described how to create a gas by heating limestone, calling it "fixed air" because it could be fixed back into a solid by combining with lime. He also found that calcium oxide turned into calcium carbonate naturally in the air, so there must be carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.	Joseph Black	Scotland	gas	Science:Chemistry		
galaxy	1755	Galaxy	Are the stars in the sky uniformly distributed, or are they contained in some particular shape? Based on the Milky Way, it seems like the latter. Kant suggested that the Sun was one of many stars in a lens-like shape, and that the Milky Way was what we see when we look along the long axis of the lens. He suggested that there were other galaxies, but this all remained unproven.	Immanuel Kant	Germany	reflecting-telescope	Space		
land-bridges	1756	Land bridges	It was so far assumed that the shape of the continents was fixed and eternal, but Desmarest pointed out similarities of the shores across the English channel, suggesting that the two land masses drifted apart over time. He incorrectly believed these changes were caused by earthquakes.	Nicolas Desmarest	France	sea-navigation	Science:Geology		
halley-comet	1758	Halley's comet	Halley predicted that the comet of 1682 would return in 1758. Amateur astronomer spotted it on Dec 25, 1758. Retrospectively, it turned out that this was the same comet seen by William the Conqueror, and the same one painted by Giotto.	Johann Georg Palitzsch	England	comet-orbits	Space		
flame-tests	1758	Flame tests	It was a difficult task for chemists to distinguish one substance from another. For example, sodium and potassium look similar, but they burn yellow and violet respectively. Further improving the process, Cronstedt introduced a blowpipe which directed a jet of air, making more granular temperature possible.	Andreas Sigismund Marggraf	Germany	nickel	Science:Chemistry		
embryology	1759	Embryology	At the time, it was customary to think that seeds, eggs, pollen, sperm, etc, had miniature organisms in them that grew. Some thought that this was recursive! Wolff found that specialized organs developed out of unspecialized tissue.	Kaspar Friedrich Wolff	Germany	plant-sexuality	Science:Biology		
earthquakes	1760	Earthquakes	Early theories attributed earthquakes to relentless gods or pent-up air underground. The Lisbon quake of 1755 forced more scientifict hinking. Mitchell noted that quakes often correlated to volcanic areas, thought underground water was boiled by volcanic heat, and caused circular waves from the epicenter. Mitchell is considered founder of seismology.	John Mitchell	England	earth-heat	Science:Geology		
heat-capacity	1760	Heat capacity	Heat was considered a special fluid which filled all substances equally based on weight. Black showed that when heating equal weights of mercury and water, mercury's temperature went up twice as fast as the water temperature did.	Joseph Black	Scotland	five-elements, mercury-thermometer	Science:Chemistry		
pathology	1760	Pathology	Morgagni published a list of 640 postmortems fully detailing the lives of his patience, development of disease and manner of death from the anatomical point of view.	Giovanni Battista Morgagni	Italy	cadaver	Science:Biology		
venus-atmosphere	1761	Venus’s atmosphere	Venus didn't appear to have any visual features except when passing directly between sun and earth (called transit of Venus). In an attempt to study Venus' parallax, an expedition was setup to observe it from many different places on earth. This effort failed because the time when venus entered and left the solar shadow could not be determined accurately. Lomonosov suggested this might be due to fuzziness caused by an atmosphere, and was right!	Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov	Russia	reflecting-telescope	Space		
percussion	1761	Medical percussion	Percussion is a method of tapping on a surface to determine the underlying structures, and is used in clinical examinations to assess the condition of the thorax or abdomen.	Leopold Auenbrugger von Auenbrug	Austria	muscles-bones	Science		
latent-heat	1762	Latent heat	Discovery that heat can be absorbed by ice without raising its temperature, leading to the concept of latent heat.	Joseph Black	Scotland	heat-capacity	Science

steam-engine	1764	Steam engine	James Watt repaired and improved a Newcomen steam engine, leading to the first reasonably efficient steam engine. He devised a method for keeping one chamber always hot and another always cold, utilizing latent heat more efficiently, which paved the way for the first truly efficient steam engine.	James Watt	Scotland	latent-heat, newcomen-steam-engine	Science		
plutonism	1765	Plutonism	Nicolas Desmarest suggested that valleys were formed by streams that ran through them, influenced by the heat from volcanic activity.	Nicolas Desmarest	France	earth-heat	Science		
hydrogen	1766	Hydrogen	Demarest discovered hydrogen (which he called 'fire air') through its properties, specifically its high flammability and low density, being one-fourteenth the density of air. His detailed studies on hydrogen's properties led to its eventual recognition as a distinct element.	Henry Cavendish	England	chemical-elements	Science		
experiments-on-nerves	1766	Experiments on nerves	Albrecht von Haller conducted experiments that led to the conclusion of nerves being responsible for muscle movement, not a fluid transmitted through nerves. Haller’s work laid the foundations for modern neurology.	Albrecht von Haller	Switzerland	cadaver	Science		
no-spontaneous-generation-redux	1768	Definitely no spontaneous generation	Lazzaro Spallanzani's experiment further challenged the idea of spontaneous generation by showing no new microorganisms appeared in broth after thoroughly boiling and sealing it.	Lazzaro Spallanzani	Italy	no-spontaneous-generation	Science		
carbonated-water	1768	Carbonated water	Joseph Priestley discovered how to infuse water with carbon dioxide to create carbonated water. This discovery led to the foundation of the soft drink industry.	Joseph Priestley	England	fermentation, carbon-dioxide	General		
quantitative-chemistry	1769	Quantitative chemistry	Lavoisier boiled water for 101 days, observing that sediment appeared and the water did not change its weight, refuting the Greek theory that water could be converted into earth. His precise, quantitative method provided clearer understanding and marked a significant advance in the field of chemistry.	Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier	France	latent-heat	Science		
spinning-frame	1769	Spinning frame	The spinning frame was a mechanical device that could produce strong and hard cotton threads quickly enough to meet the demands of the booming textile industry. His invention made cotton manufacturing faster and more cost-effective, requiring relatively unskilled workers and little money	Richard Arkwright	England	mechanics, flying-shuttle	Design		
nile-river	1770	Nile river	Bruce journeyed upstream to Khartoum in Sudan where he determined the confluence of the White Nile from the southwest and the Blue Nile from the southeast, identifying its source to Ethiopia, which was previously unknown to European explorers.	James Bruce	Scotland		Geography		
gulf-stream	1770	Gulf stream	Franklin, after traveling from America to Europe multiple times, became aware of the difference in eastward and westward sailing times due to ocean currents. He produced a map of the Gulf Stream, beginning of the scientific study of ocean currents.	Benjamin Franklin	England	ocean-navigation	Geography		
soluble-gases	1770	Soluble gases	Priestley became the first person to infuse gases such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride into an upside-down mercury-filled vessel, allowing for the collection of gases that could not be captured through water because they dissolve in water.	Joseph Priestley	England	gas	Science		
nebulas	1771	Nebulas	Initially frustrated by his findings of fuzzy objects that were not comets but rather "nebulosities" fixed in space, he compiled a list of these objects. This list of nebulas includes many star clusters and distant galaxies.	Charles Messier	France	reflecting-telescope, andromeda-nebula	Science		
plants-and-carbon-dioxide	1771	Plants and carbon dioxide	Carbon dioxide was understood to support the respiration of plants, with the notable experiment involving a plant surviving in carbon dioxide-rich air.	Joseph Priestley	England	carbon-dioxide	Science		
combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	1772	Combustion and phlogiston	Chemists of the time thought combustible items contained a substance called phlogiston, from a Greek word meaning 'to set on fire.' Lavoisier began weighing objects in closed volumes and evaluating the volume and weight before and after combustion, refuting the idea that phlogiston was lost and moving towards the understanding of oxygen and its role in combustion.	Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier	France	five-elements	Science		
diamond	1772	Diamond	Antoine Lavoisier burned diamond and observed it in a closed vessel, proving that it was a form of Carbon. He indicated that when it grew hot enough, it simply disappeared, contributing to disprove the phlogiston theory.	Antoine Lavoisier	France	combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	Science		
nitrogen	1772	Nitrogen	Daniel Rutherford asked a question regarding what happens if a candle is burned until no further burning air is possible, which led him to discover a new gas eventually called nitrogen. This gas does not support combustion or sustain life, showing it was neither combustible like oxygen nor able to support life like carbon dioxide.	Daniel Rutherford	England	carbon-dioxide, combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	Science		
antarctic-circle	1773	Antarctic Circle	The Antarctic Circle was first crossed at sea by Captain James Cook.	James Cook	England	ocean-navigation	Geography		
bacilli	1773	Bacilli	Bacteria could be seen more distinctly than before and categorized by their shapes. Microorganisms were classified into genera and species as per the methods of Linnaeus, particularly identifying rod-shaped bacteria as 'bacilli', spiral-shaped ones as 'spirilla'.	Otto Friedrich Müller	Denmark	microscope	Science		
oxygen	1774	Oxygen	Priestley discovered a gas he called 'dephlogisticated air' and eventually oxygen. It allowed combustibles to burn more brilliantly and rapidly than in ordinary air and seemed to have an invigorating effect when inhaled.	Joseph Priestley	England	gas	Science		
chlorine-oxygen	1774	Chlorine oxygen	Scheele isolated the gas chlorine, which was colorless and greenish-yellow in color, named from the Greek word for 'green'. However, Scheele thought it was a combination of some substance with oxygen and did not recognize it as an element, which prevented him from obtaining the credit for its discovery until about thirty years later.	Carl Wilhelm Scheele	Sweden	oxygen	Science		
mesmerism	1774	Mesmerism	Messmer's waved magnets over his patients while reciting prayers, claiming the ability to cure various diseases. Though his methods were discredited, the mind's effect on the body was intriguing and his experiments became the basis of modern hypnosis.	Franz Anton Mesmer	Germany	pathology	Culture		
digitalis	1775	Digitalis	An English physician discovered the medicinal properties of the foxglove plant for heart conditions. The substance obtained was key in treating edema caused by a failing heart, reigniting interest in plant-based medicines.	William Withering	England	medicinal-plants	Science		
races	1776	Races	A classification of the human species into five races was proposed, lead by descriptive criteria such as skin color and physical features without implying any important differences between these groups.	Johann Friedrich Blumenbach	Germany		Culture		
torsion-balance	1777	Torsion balance	The torsion balance uses a fiber or wire's ability to twist under a force to measure weight, providing a way to more precisely measure weight.	Charles-Augustin de Coulomb	France	mechanics	Science		
molybdenum	1778	Molybdenum	Scheele discovered molybdenum, a new chemical element, using methods he had previously applied to isolate another element, manganese.	Scheele	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science		
hawaiian-islands	1778	Hawaiian Islands	Captain Cook explored the Pacific coast of North America and later claimed the Hawaiian Islands for Britain, naming them the Sandwich Islands. This discovery extended British claims in the Pacific region.	James Cook	England	pacific-ocean	Geography		
fertilization	1779	Fertilization	It was discovered that fertilization in humans involved male sperms physically contacting the eggs within the female ovaries, contrary to the prior belief that males provided the 'seed' and females were simply the soil. This newfound understanding clarified that reproduction was a joint process involving contributions from both the mother and father.	Lazzaro Spallanzani	Italy	no-spontaneous-generation	Science		
photosynthesis	1779	Photosynthesis	The process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose, using sunlight as the energy source, was further elucidated. This essential plant function that produces not only oxygen but also complex organic molecules.	Jan Ingenhousz	Netherlands	plants-and-carbon-dioxide	Science		
electrical-stimulation	1780	Electrical stimulation	This invention demonstrated that the muscles of dissected frog legs twitched when struck by a spark from a Leyden jar, suggesting that muscles were activated by electrical impulses. This foundational experiment led to significant insights into bioelectric phenomena in living tissues and laid the foundation for electrophysiology.	Luigi Galvani	Italy	lightning-rod	Science		
uranus	1781	Uranus	The discovery of Uranus expanded our knowledge of the solar system by revealing a seventh planet. This celestial body was initially mistaken for a comet but was identified due to its distinct circular and sharp-edged appearance.	William Herschel	England	telescope	Space		
binary-stars	1781	Binary stars	Two stars sometimes orbit each other due to gravitational forces. The discovery contradicted the earlier belief that close pairs of stars were merely coincidentally aligned, showing that they could in fact be gravitationally bound and move in relation to each other.	William Herschel	England	universal-gravitation	Space		
crystallography	1781	Crystallography	Modern crystallography were established through the discovery that crystal shapes are built from unit cells that stack in a regular pattern spontaneously. 	René-Just Haüy	France	microscope	Science		
mars-axial-tilt	1781	Axial inclination of mars	The axial inclination of Mars was identified, illustrating that like Earth, Mars has a tilted axis which causes seasonal variations similar to those on Earth. The discovery contributed to the understanding of planetary motions and their effects on climate.	William Herschel	England	planet-rotations	Space		
improved-steam-engine	1781	Improved steam engine	Watt's enhancements increased efficiency and power output by recycling steam, maintaining constant cylinder pressure, and enabling use of the engine for driving machinery, which was a pivotal development in the industrial revolution.	James Watt	England	steam-engine	General

rosetta-stone	1799	Rosetta Stone	The Rosetta Stone is an artifact discovered in 1799 bearing an inscription in three forms of writing: Greek, Demotic, and Hieroglyphic, which allowed scholars to begin deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Its discovery provided the key to understanding large portions of Egyptian history that were previously obscure.	Napoleon	French	writing	Culture		
electric-battery	1800	Electric battery	Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery, theorizing that electricity originated in metals and not in biological tissue. His invention led to the creation of a continuous electric current, advancing beyond the non-flowing electric charge of static electricity.	Alessandro Giuseppe Volta	Italy	static-electricity	Science	In 1800, Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist, developed the electric battery based on his hypothesis that electricity was a property of metals rather than originating from muscle tissue, as previously thought by Luigi Galvani. Volta's battery harnessed chemical reactions to produce a steady and continuous flow of electricity, which was a significant advance over static electricity and had tremendous implications for the future use and distribution of electrical power. The first batteries used bowls of salt solution to facilitate the chemical reaction needed for the generation of electricity.	
decomposition-of-water	1800	Decomposition of water	This process involved using an electric current to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, revealing the elemental composition of water. It was a foundational experiment demonstrating the use of electricity to drive a chemical reaction.	William Nicholson	England	electric-battery	Science	Following the invention of the Volta's pile, William Nicholson used the battery to pass an electric current through slightly acidified water. The process of electrolysis resulted in the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, confirming that water was composed of these two elements.	
infrared-radiation	1800	Infrared radiation	This discovery identified invisible infrared radiation as a form of light that causes heating effects, extending the known electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. The work was significant for understanding the nature of electromagnetic waves and led to the development of technologies utilizing infrared.	William Herschel	England	binary-stars	Science	Building on previous work in the study of the light spectrum in 1781, an experiment conducted in 1800 showed that upon placing a thermometer just beyond the red end of the visible light spectrum, an increase in temperature was detected despite the absence of visible light. This revealed the presence of a form of light invisible to the human eye, which we now know as infrared radiation.	
gas-lighting	1800	Gas lighting	Gas powered light involved the burning of coal to produce flammable gases, which could be transported and used for illumination. It revolutionized lighting, allowing for the first widespread street and indoor lighting.	William Murdoch	England	candle	Design	The invention of gas lighting by William Murdoch marked the transition from traditional oil and wax based lighting to a system where coal-derived gases could be piped and burned to create light. Murdoch's innovation eventually led to the widespread use of gas lighting in streets and homes, vastly improving illumination and extending productive hours after sundown.	
nitrous-oxide	1800	Nitrous oxide	Nitrous oxide is a gas that induces a state of exhilaration and anesthesia when inhaled, with effects including laughter and pain suppression. It was initially a novelty but found practical use in dentistry as an anesthetic.	Humphry Davy	England	dentistry,oxygen	Science	A British chemist, Humphry Davy, discovered nitrous oxide in 1800. Through his experimental work with the gas, Davy identified its anesthetic properties, reporting a reduction in pain sensation when inhaled. Eventually, it became widely used in dentistry for its anesthetic qualities and was also popularized as a short-lived social fad for its euphoriant effects.	
tissues	1800	Tissues	Careful observations (without a microscope) showed Bichat that the various organs were built up out of a mixture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usually flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues.	Marie François Xavier Bichat	France	cadaver	Science	The French physician Marie François Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) was notable for the many postmortems he conducted in his very short profes- sional life. His careful ob- servations (without a microscope) showed him that the various organs were built up out of a mix- ture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usu- ally flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues. In 1800 he published a book called Treatise on Membranes in which he listed and carefully de- scribed twenty-one differ- ent types of tissues. He is for this reason considered the founder of the science of histology (the study of tis-sues).	
malleable-platinum	1801	Malleable platinum	Wollaston devised a method for making platnium malleable despite its inertness and high melting point. He kept the method secret. Working with platnium he also discovered two other metals very similar in properties to it. These were palladium and rhodium.	William Hyde Wollaston	England	platinum	Science	Platinum, because of its in- ertness and its high melting point, would be marvelously suited to laboratory equipment fi only it could be easily worked and pounded into shape. A method for doing so was worked out by a British chemist, William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828), iHe kept his method secret and never allowed anyone in his laboratory. In this way he earned a fortune. He arranged to have his method published after his death. In working with plati-num, he discovered two other metals very similar in properties to it. These were palladium and rhodium.	
jacquard-loom	1801	Jacquard loom	The Jacquard Loom revolutionized the weaving process by allowing intricate patterns to be woven automatically. It used punched cards to control the loom's needles, enabling it to create complex textile designs with less manual labor.	Joseph-Marie Jacquard	France	flying-shuttle	Design	The Jacquard Loom was an innovation that allowed textiles to be woven with complex patterns without requiring the intensive manual labor that was traditionally necessary. This machine used a series of punched cards, which corresponded to a particular pattern. When these cards were used in the loom, needles would pass through the holes to form the desired pattern in the textile. This automation of pattern weaving not only increased production efficiency but also allowed for the creation of much more intricate designs than were previously feasible by hand weaving.	
discovery-of-ceres	1801	Discovery of Ceres	Ceres was discovered by an Italian astronomer when he serendipitously spotted the object while working at an observatory, and it was notable for being the first known dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This discovery adhered to the predictions made by Bode's law regarding planetary distances.	Giuseppe Piazzi	Italy	jupiter-moons, mars-distance	Space	Ceres was discovered on January 1, 1801, fitting within the framework of Bode's law, which suggested the placement of a planet between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres, though smaller than Mars and more slowly moving, however, turned out to be a dwarf planet and not a full-sized planet as Johann Elert Bode's law had predicted, marking an important contribution to astronomical understanding at the time.	
invertebrates	1801	Invertebrates	Up to now, less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for 'worms"). Lamarck divided the invertebrates into groups like the crustaceans, echinoderms, and distinguished between the eight-legged arachnids and the six-legged insects.	Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck	France	taxonomy	Science	Linnaeus (see 1735) and others in the past three- quarters of a century had elaborated the taxonomy of vertebrates (those animals with backbones-mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fish) in considerable detail. The less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for " 'worms"). The French naturalist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) tackled the problem in publications beginning in 1801. He divided the invertebrates into groups and created such di- visions as the crustaceans(crabs and lobsters) and echinoderms (starfish andsea urchins). He distin-guishedbetween the eight- legged arachnids (spiders and scorpions) and the six-legged insects. In fact, La- marck was the first to usethe terms vertebrate and in-vertebrate, and he popular- ized the term biolog y for the study of life	
ultraviolet	1800	Ultraviolet	This discovery revealed that the spectrum of light extends beyond the visible violet end, where darkening paper soaked in silver nitrate suggested a new type of radiation termed 'ultraviolet' because it is beyond the visible spectrum. The discovery showcased the existence of light that is not visible to the naked eye but has measurable effects.	Johann Wilhelm Ritter	Germany	infrared-radiation	Science	In 1800, an individual working on the study of the spectrum of light realized that soaked paper in silver nitrate darkened rapidly when exposed to the spectrum's end beyond the visible violet spectrum. The effect was less pronounced at the red end of the spectrum, leading to the conclusion that there is radiation beyond the visible spectrum termed 'ultraviolet', indicating its position beyond the violet light. n founding the modrn science of invertebrate zoology, Lamarck began the process of understanding the importance of inverte- brate life. All the verte- brates are included in but a single phylum, while there are about twenty-two phyla of invertebrates. The number of species of insects alone far exceeds the number of species of vertebrates; indeed, it exceeds the number of species of all other animals combined.	
light-waves	1801	Light waves	Young's famous double slit interference experiments with light confirmed its wave-like behavior, demonstrating that light can exhibit patterns of interference similar to waves in water or sound, which supported the wave theory of light.	Thomas Young	England	light-diffraction, light-as-wave	Science	In 1801, an English physicist started a series of experiments that showed light could exhibit wave-like properties through interference patterns. By allowing two beams of light to overlap and interfere with each other, it was proven that light consists of waves of different lengths, which reinforced the argument that light is a wave and not just a particle, challenging previously held notions about the fundamental nature of light.	
discovery-of-niobium	1801	Discovery of niobium	An English chemist discovered a new element within a mineral from the British Museum, initially calling it Columbium (after Columbia, a name for the US), but it later became officially known as niobium. The element's establishment was contentious due to national pride and scientific debate.	Charles Hatchett	England	chemical-elements	Science	Charles Hatchett analyzed a mineral from the British Museum, which was sent there from Connecticut, and identified a new element in 1801. There was a dispute over whether the substance was a new element, but it was finally accepted and officially named niobium, with Hatchett initially calling it columbium in honor of the 'Columbia' (a historical name for the United States). Despite the initial naming, the United States lost the honor of having the element named after it.	
asteroids	1802	Asteroids	This discovery refers to the identification of new celestial bodies between Mars and Jupiter, which were distinct from planets due to their smaller size. They were initially named after Greek deities and later became known as the asteroid belt.	Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers	Germany	discovery-of-ceres	Space	In 1802, following the discovery of Ceres in 1801, German scientists led by Olbers found another celestial body between Mars and Jupiter, naming it Pallas. Further discoveries led to the identification of additional bodies, such as Athena in 1804, and Vesta and Juno in 1807. These bodies were smaller than planets and were eventually realized to be part of a larger collection that would be called asteroids, forming the asteroid belt.	
tantalum	1802	Tantalum	The invention is the discovery of a new metal, which was named after the Greek mythological figure Tantalus. It is a rare, hard, blue-gray metal known for its resistance to corrosion paralleling Tantalus's own unattainable desires.	Anders Gustav Ekeberg	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	Anders Gustav Ekeberg, a Swedish chemist, analyzed minerals from Finland and discovered a new metal in 1802, which he named tantalum. The name was inspired by the Greek mythological figure Tantalus, reflecting the metal's resistance to absorption and corrosion, paralleling Tantalus's own unattainable desires.	
atomic-theory	1803	Atomic theory	The Atomic Theory posits that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms, which combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds. It laid the groundwork for modern chemistry and provided a systematic explanation for chemical reactions based on the combination and rearrangement of atoms.	John Dalton	England	boyles-law	Science	In 1803, an English chemist put forth a comprehensive summary of atomic theory, which suggested that all matter is made up of atoms. This was a more defined, evidence-based approach that built upon Boyle's law and personal investigations. The chemist proposed the idea, for instance, that 8 grams of oxygen would combine with 1 gram of hydrogen to form 9 grams of water, implying that the compound would have a correlating weight. Dalton even utilized the term 'atom' from Democritus but provided a new theory based on experiments and careful chemical observation rather than speculation.	
meteorites	1803	Meteorites	Biot investigated hundreds of supposed meteorite sightings and concluded that the reports were correct and that meteorites did exist and did fall from the sky.	Jean-Baptiste Biot	France	meteorites-hypothesis	Space	Scientist Chladni's work in the late 18th century prompted the scientific community to seriously consider the possibility of meteorites. Following this, Jean-Baptiste Biot confirmed reports of stone falls by examining falls in a region 100 miles west of Paris, arguably laying the foundation for modern planetary science.	
cerium-osmium-iridium	1803	Cerium, Osmium, Iridium	Three new elements were discovered, expanding the periodic table and contributing to the understanding of Earth's composition and the diversity of naturally occurring elements.	Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	New chemical elements, specifically cerium, osmium, and iridium, were discovered in 1803 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius and his colleagues. The discovery of these elements not only broadened the scope of known elements during that period but also provided new substances for study and use in various chemical applications.	
scientific-ballooning	1804	Scientific ballooning	A balloon carrying Biote and Gay-Lussac ascent reached an alpine peak in the Alps (4 miles elevation) to test the composition of the air and to study Earth's magnetic field. This kicked off significant use of balloons for conducting scientific research and marked the beginning of high-altitude explorations.	Jean-Baptiste Biot and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac	France	hot-air-balloon, scientific-voyages	Science	Scientific ballooning began in 1804 when Biote and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac made a balloon ascent reaching a height of 4 miles, reaching an alpine peak in the Alps. This endeavor enabled them to test the composition of the air and to study Earth's magnetic field, contrasting their findings with measurements at sea level, which showed no change, laying the groundwork for future atmospheric explorations.	
steam-locomotive	1804	Steam locomotive	The concept of a steam locomotive was based on the idea that if steam can turn paddle wheels in water, it should be able to turn wheels on land. Early designs faced challenges such as losing too much energy until Trevithick invented iron rails on which the wheels rode. Still he did not reach commercial success.	Richard Trevithick	England	improved-steam-engine	General	The concept of a steam locomotive was based on the idea that if steam can turn paddle wheels in water, it should be able to turn wheels on land. The early steam-powered vehicle faced challenges such as losing too much energy but paved the way for the subsequent development of more efficient steam locomotive designs.	
missouri-river	1804	Missouri River	The Lewis and Clark Expedition explored the Missouri river to its source, onward to the Oregon Territory, then to the Columbia River into the Pacific ocean, the first ocean-to-ocean and back trip across the United States.	Meriwether Lewis and William Clark	United States	america	Geography		
morphine	1805	Morphine	An alcoholic extract of immature opium blooms was called laudanum and had first been introduced by Paracelsus. The chemical eventually named morphene and found much more effective in dulling pain and inducing sleep than the juice itself.	Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Ferdinand Serturner	Germany	mineralogy	Science	Morphine, extracted from opium poppies, was developed as a medication to alleviate severe pain without causing the patient to lose consciousness. It represented a major advancement in pain management and remains one of the most potent analgesics used in medicine today, although it also has the potential for addiction and abuse.	
asparagine	1806	Asparagine	Asparagine was the first amino acid to be isolated, marking a significant milestone in the field of organic chemistry and biochemistry. This discovery laid the groundwork for understanding the role of amino acids in biological systems.	Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin	Germany		Science	In 1806, a substance called asparagine was isolated from asparagus, which was eventually realized to be the first of a set of compounds extremely important to life, known as amino acids. The isolation of asparagine pointed to a broader understanding of the biological importance of amino acids.	
sodium-and-potassium	1807	Sodium and potassium	New elemental metals, sodium and potassium, were isolated using electrolysis, a process that uses an electric current to decompose substances. This breakthrough enabled the isolation of several alkali metals, which had a significant impact on the development of the field of electrochemistry.	Humphry Davy	England	decomposition-of-water	Science	The isolation of sodium and potassium was achieved by passing an electric current through molten potassium carbonate and then through a solution of sodium carbonate. The electrolysis process resulted in the liberation of the metals which were previously unable to be isolated by conventional chemical means. This experiment led to the isolation of the alkali metals barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium in the subsequent year and excited the scientific world, propelling the study of electrochemistry.	
working-steamboat	1807	Practical Steamboat	The completion of the steamboat Clermont marked a significant development in navigable technology, making the steamboat a commercial success. It traveled from New York to Albany in record time, at an avearge speed of 5 mph.	Robert Fulton	United States	steamboat	Design	Robert Fulton is credited with making the steamboat a commercial success, culminating in 1807 with the creation of the Clermont. This steamboat was 133 feet long and could maintain an average speed of nearly 5 miles per hour. With the introduction of the Clermont, the use of steamboats proliferated, enhancing trade and passenger transport on rivers and coastal waters, and setting the stage for the expansion of the steamboat fleet.	
polarized-light	1808	Polarized light	By playing with a crystal of Iceland spar, visible light could be polarized, thus finding that light could exhibit properties similar to that of a magnet with different poles. 	Étienne-Louis Malus	France	double-refraction	Science	The discovery was made when the physicist observed that when sunlight passed through a crystal of Iceland spar, instead of showing double refraction as expected, it produced a single ray of light after passing through the crystal at a certain angle. When the crystal was aligned at right angles to its original direction, a new ray of light appeared while the first ray disappeared; a phenomenon the physicist named polarized light, although his initial assumption about light having poles like magnets turned out to be incorrect.	
mechanism-of-evolution	1809	Mechanism of evolution	Lamarck theorized that the use or disuse of certain body parts by animals could lead to the development of these parts and potentially be inherited by offspring, contributing to evolutionary changes.	Jean-Baptiste Lamarck	France	invertebrates	Science	The theory posited that biological evolution had taken place and could be influenced by organisms' interaction with their environment. For instance, the theory suggested that giraffes developed longer necks to reach leaves, and these traits could be passed on to their offspring. This idea stems from the concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was later shown not to be a mechanism of inheritance. Nonetheless, the publication stirred interest in the field of evolution.	
aerodynamics	1809	Aerodynamics	Cayley visualized flying devices with fixed wings; tails with control surfaces to allow turning and braking, and propulsive mechanisms. 	George Cayley	England	mechanics	Science	The dream of human flight led to the establishment of foundational principles in aerodynamics, with early conceptualizations of flying devices that used fixed wings and appropriate surfaces to interact with air currents for lift, control, and movement. The publications from 1809 by a British scientist began to lay down the theoretical groundwork for these ideas, which would greatly influence the future of flight technology.	
phrenology	1810	Phrenology	Gall proposed that the brain's shape played a major role in its function, and that its shape could be determined by the irregularities and bumps externally visible on the skull. This pseudoscientific discipline was later discredited.	Franz Joseph Gall	Germany	races, brain-areas	Culture	In 1810, German physician Franz Joseph Gall published the first volume of a four-volume treatise on the nervous system, which outlined the foundations of phrenology. Gall believed that mental capacities and different parts of the brain involved with different parts of the human body could be correlated with the shape of the brain. According to this theory, certain brain areas corresponding to certain traits resulted in bulges or indentations on the skull, allowing one to analyze a person’s psychological attributes by examining these bumps on the head.	
chlorine	1810	Chlorine	Up to now, chlorine was considered to be an oxygen-containing compound. Davy showed this was not so, and that chlorine was a distinct element. 	Humphry Davy	England	oxygen, chlorine-oxygen	Science	Chlorine was identified as an element by Davy, refuting prior beliefs that it was a compound containing oxygen as suggested by Scheele. Davy's work on hydrochloric acid showed that chlorine, present within the acid, did not contain oxygen, contrary to the common thought of the time which associated acid properties to the presence of oxygen.	
avogadro-hypothesis	1811	Avogadro's hypothesis	This hypothesis states that all gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles, thereby explaining the relationship between the volume and number of particles of a gas. 	Amedeo Avogadro	Italy	atomic-theory	Science	Avogadro's hypothesis posited that at equal temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain an equal number of particles, regardless of the type of gas. This principle was foundational for developing a deeper understanding of molecular composition and stoichiometry in chemistry. Avogadro suggested that substances like water vapor were composed of molecules, specifically, in water's case, of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and not as single atoms as John Dalton had previously suggested. This idea facilitated the conceptual separation of atoms and molecules and led to essential developments in the molecular theory of gases and compounds.	
iodine	1811	Iodine	Iodine was discovered by a French chemist when he was manufacturing potassium nitrate for gunpowder and accidentally added too much acid to potassium carbonate. This resulted in a beautiful violet vapor that condensed into dark, lustrous crystals. It was suspected to be a new element, confirmed by chemists, and named from the Greek word for 'violet'.	Bernard Courtois	France	gunpowder	Science	While manufacturing potassium nitrate needed in gunpowder, Bernard Courtois added too much acid to potassium carbonate and upon heating, obtained a violet vapor that condensed into dark crystals. After his discovery, he suspected it might be a new element and passed it on for confirmation. It was eventually confirmed and the name 'iodine' was suggested, originating from the Greek word for violet.	
catalysis	1812	Catalysis	Starch was first converted into a sugar (corn syrup), by heating it with sulfuric acid in acid-catalyzed reaction. Since the sulfuric acid was not consumed, it was the first documented example of catalysis in organic chemistry, even though the general concept of catalysis was known (e.g. yeast). 	Gottlieb Sigismund Constantin Kirchhoff	Russia	fermentation	Science	Humans have known since ancient times that substances like yeast can cause reactions indefinitely without being consumed themselves. This concept was further explored by Gottlieb Sigismund Constantin Kirchhoff, who pondered the idea of non-living substances that could catalyze changes, leading to a deeper understanding of chemical reactions.	
catastrophism	1812	Catastrophism	Cuvier's concept of catastrophism was based on the observation that fossils seemed to represent extinct creatures and that the deeper the strata, the less the fossils resembled modern organisms, implying a succession of catastrophic events. Cuvier is considered the founder of paleontology.	Georges Cuvier	France	uniformitarianism	Science	Georges Cuvier's work on catastrophism involved the study of fossils to advance the idea that Earth's natural history was influenced by a series of catastrophic events that led to the mass extinctions of certain life forms, with new forms arising post these events. This challenged the previously dominant view of uniformitarianism and underlined the belief in successive creations in Earth's history.	
universe-as-machine	1812	Universe as machine	Laplace suggested a deterministic universe, proposing that if one knew the position and velocity of every particle, the future and past of the universe could be calculated, eliminating the need for divine intervention. This idea formalized the concept of a universe obeying mechanical laws without exception.	Pierre-Simon Laplace	France	laws-motion	Science	Pierre-Simon Laplace's theory posited that the universe operates like a vast automatic machine following a predetermined path. According to his hypothesis, by knowing the position and velocity of all particles, one could predict future events which led to the philosophical viewpoint that a mechanistic universe operates without the need for a Godly figure to guide or intervene in natural processes.	
chemical-symbols	1813	Chemical symbols	A system for representing atoms using simple letters was adopted, with single letters or letter pairs denoting elements like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and more complex symbols for compounds. The system simplified the communication and instruction of chemical compositions and continues to be standard in chemistry.	Jöns Jakob Berzelius	Sweden	atomic-theory	Science	With the advancement of atomic theory, there arose the need for a simple method to represent atoms. In 1813, this led to the use of letters, such as H for a hydrogen atom and O for an oxygen atom, among others, as a standardized system for representing chemical elements and compounds, which simplified scientific communication and is still in use today.	
plant-classification	1813	Plant classification	This new plant classification system was a significant part of a large encyclopedia project that improved the system of plant classification beyond that of Linnaeus, providing a more detailed basis for the scientific understanding and categorization of plants.	Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle	France	taxonomy, plant-species-classified	Science	In 1813, French botanist Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle began an ambitious project to catalog plant life, devising an improved system of classification. While only seven of the projected twenty volumes were published before his death, his work built upon and refined Linnaean taxonomy, offering a more detailed plant classification system still in use today.	
spectral-lines	1814	Spectral lines	Meticulously crafted prisms could be used to observe dark lines in the solar spectrum, leading to the identification of nearly six hundred lines. These lines, known as Fraunhofer lines, marked the wavelengths where light was absorbed and became foundational in the fields of chemistry and astronomy for identifying elemental composition.	Joseph von Fraunhofer	Germany	light-spectrum	Science	Since Isaac Newton's initial study of the spectrum in 1666, the understanding of light had not significantly advanced until 1814 when a German physicist crafted precise prisms and observed the solar spectrum through a narrow slit. By observing and mapping the positions of these dark lines, known as Fraunhofer lines, he laid the groundwork for spectroscopy, which would become an essential tool for chemists and astronomers to determine the composition of different materials and celestial bodies.	
plane-of-polarized-light	1815	Plane of polarized light	An experiment showed that two pieces of Iceland spar, if lined up parallel, allow unpolarized light to pass through unimpeded, while if one piece is rotated, the plane of the polarized light must be turned for the light to pass through again. 	Jean-Baptiste Biot	France	polarized-light	Science	In 1815, it was discovered that polarized light could behave differently when it passed through organic substances. Specifically, when Iceland spar (calcite) was used to polarize light, and then the polarized light was passed through an organic liquid, the plane of polarization had to be rotated to allow the light to continue through another piece of Iceland spar. This effect was noted since certain organic liquids caused the light to twist, suggesting an asymmetry in the molecules of organic substances. Important connections were made regarding the interaction between light and the structure of organic molecules.	
organic-radicals	1815	Organic radicals	Through work with poisonous gas hydrogen cyanide, he discovered another gas cyanogen (CN_2), and went to show that carbon-nitrogen or cyano group is very stable and maintained integrity through various chemical changes. A significant contribution to organic chemistry.	Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac	France	chemical-elements	Science	In 1815, a scientific breakthrough occurred with the understanding of organic radicals, which are groups of atoms that remain consistent through different chemical reactions. The discovery that was highlighted is the identification of cyanogen, a carbon-nitrogen compound, which maintained its structural integrity as it transferred as a unit through various chemical reactions. This concept was instrumental in progressing the understanding of organic chemistry and the behavior of organic compounds during chemical changes.	
prouts-hypothesis	1815	Prout's hypothesis	Prout's Hypothesis suggested that all atomic weights are whole number multiples of hydrogen, proposing that hydrogen constitutes the fundamental atom and that other elements are composed of hydrogen atoms. This was a significant step in atomic theory, though it was later proven to be an oversimplification.	William Prout 	England	atomic-theory	Science	An English chemist in 1815 put forward a hypothesis that posited hydrogen as the primary building block of all other elements, suggesting that the atomic weights of elements are integral multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. While this theory greatly influenced the atomic theory, it was eventually refined as inaccuracies were discovered. The concept, however, helped pave the way for our current understanding of atomic structure and elemental composition.	
macadamized-roads	1815	Macadamized roads	Macadamized roads (named after the inventor) improved on older road construction methods and involved laying stones of specific sizes in layers and then compacting them for durability and raising them for proper drainage. They became prominent in Great Britain before spreading to other countries.	John Loudon McAdam	England	paved-road	Design	Paved roads, or 'Macadamized Roads', were invented in 1815 by John Loudon McAdam, who discovered a more efficient road-building method involving laying stones in layers with larger sizes at the base and smaller ones on the surface, followed by compaction with fine gravel or slag. This technique improved upon previous road-building methods by creating a road surface that was elevated above adjacent fields for better water runoff and that was significantly more durable and effective for transportation.	
stethoscope	1816	Stethoscope	The stethoscope is a medical device used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs, and other organs in the human body. It was a significant advancement in diagnostic procedures which previously relied on placing the ear directly to the patient for auscultation.	René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laënnec	France	microscope	Science	Diagnostic procedures were limited in the early days of modern medicine, but one obvious way of getting information was to place the ear to the chest wall and listen to the sound of the heartbeat. In 1816, a French physician, faced with the necessity of listening to the heartbeat of a young woman, invented the stethoscope as a means to maintain decorum and improve the audibility of internal sounds. He used a rolled-up piece of paper to create a tube that amplified these sounds, which he found to be louder compared to directly placing his ear against the patient's chest.	
chlorophyll	1817	Chlorophyll	The discovery of chlorophyll marked a significant advancement in plant chemistry, identifying the substance responsible for the green pigmentation in plants that also plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by trapping sunlight and converting it into energy, which in turn creates plant tissue and oxygen.	Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou	France	photosynthesis	Science	Building on prior research into how plants restore the vitality of air, two scientists in 1817 isolated a green compound from plants that was critical for photosynthesis. This compound, later named chlorophyll, is essential for plants to capture light energy and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, a process fundamental to plant life and the broader ecosystem.	
cadmium-lithium-selenium	1817	Cadmium, Lithium, Selenium	New chemical elements cadmium, lithium, and selenium were isolated, expanding the knowledge of the periodic table and contributing to various scientific and industrial applications.	Friedrich Strohmeyer, Johan August Arfwedson, and Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Germany and Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	Friedrich Strohmeyer discovered cadmium in zinc carbonate while analyzing an impurity that appeared during strong heating, naming it after the Latin word for calamine. Johan August Arfwedson identified lithium in mineral petalite, named after the Greek word for stone, and Jöns Jacob Berzelius discovered selenium in sulfuric acid chamber muds, naming it after the Greek word for moon.	
transverse-light-waves	1818	Transverse light waves	Fresnel suggested that light was a transverse wave, suggesting that it would explain reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Furthermore, a transverse wave would explain polarization.	Augustin-Jean Fresnel	France	light-waves,plane-of-polarized-light	Science	In 1818, a French physicist published a treatise that considered transverse light waves in a detailed mathematical way, showing that such waves would account for reflection, refraction, and diffraction just as well as longitudinal waves. The discovery explained polarized light, which couldn't be elucidated by the previously accepted model of light purely consisting of longitudinal waves.	
enckes-comet	1818	Encke's comet	Encke's Comet was the second comet after Halley's whose cometary orbit had been worked out. This one was the first short-period comet, with a period of 3.3 years, which challenged previous celestial calculations.	Johann Franz Encke	Germany	halley-comet	Space	German astronomer Johann Franz Encke calculated the orbit of a comet that was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons and concluded that it had a short period of return. The comet, now known as Encke's Comet, had its orbit calculated precisely, something no previous comet had achieved.	
atomic-weights	1818	Atomic weights	After thousands of analyses on chemicals, Berzelius published a table of atomic weights. This marked a milestone in the field of chemistry, providing a systematic foundation for the identification and classification of elements.	Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Sweden	chemical-nomenclature	Science	In 1818, a chemist felt justified in publishing a table of atomic weights based on thousands of analyses on various chemicals after years of meticulous work. This table helped standardize chemical weights and contributed to the progress of chemical science by providing a more consistent way to classify and identify elements.	
specific-heat	1819	Specific heat	Each substance requires a certain amount of heat to raise its temperature by 1 degree C. This discovery showed that the specific heat of an element was inversely proportional to its atomic weight.	Pierre-Louis Dulong and Alexis-Thérèse Petit	France	atomic-theory	Science		
steamship	1819	Steamship	The steamship combined steam-powered engine technology with traditional sail-based navigation. Although largely reliant on sails, the steam engine on board opened up new possibilities of travel and trade by providing consistent power, particularly important for gentler rivers where wind conditions could be less favorable.	John Fitch and Robert Fulton	United States	working-steamboat, ocean-navigation	General	The steamboats designed by John Fitch and later improved by Robert Fulton were primarily intended for river travel, utilizing steam engine power to propel the vessel. The notable journey of the American steamship Savannah in 1819 demonstrated the potential of this technology by sailing from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool, England, despite the steam engine being active for only a small portion of the voyage.	
electromagnetism	1820	Electromagnetism	Electrical current flowing through wires creates magnetic fields, which can cause a compass needle to deflect and current-carrying wires to attract or repel each other. This discovery established the foundation of electro-magnetism in physics.	Hans Christian Ørsted 	Denmark	compass	Science	In 1820, it was demonstrated that an electric current creates a magnetic field. When currents flowed in opposite directions through wires placed close together, the wires repelled each other, whereas they attracted each other when the currents flowed in the same direction. This interaction was further illustrated by André-Marie Ampère, who showed that current flowing through a wire bent into a helix could strengthen the magnetic effect, with the helix acting like a magnet with a north pole and a south pole.	
simple-electromagnet	1820	Simple electromagnet	Electromagnetism was improved upon by André-Marie Ampère, who showed that current flowing through a wire bent into a helix could strengthen the magnetic effect, with the helix acting like a magnet with a north pole and a south pole.	André-Marie Ampère	France	electromagnetism	Science		
glycine	1820	Glycine	Glycine is a simple amino acid discovered by heating gelatin with acids, which was eventually found to consist of bound substances that could split apart, revealing a hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen combination distinct from sugars. This discovery was significant in the study of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.	Henri Braconnot	France	catalysis	Science	Following Friedrich Accum and others' work on isolating substances from complex compounds, the substance glycine was identified after gelatin, derived from animals, was heated with acids. It was named glycine from the Greek word for sweet, and it was eventually recognized as an amino acid, not a sugar, due to its chemical composition featuring hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms, unlike sugars which do not contain nitrogen atoms.	
antarctic-land	1820	Antarctic land	This discovery marked the first known sighting of the Antarctic peninsula, a significant landmass north of the Antarctic Circle, by a British naval commander and a Russian explorer in the same geographical region. It contributed to early 19th-century exploration efforts and laid the groundwork for future Antarctic expeditions.	Palmer, Bransfield, Bellingshausen	America, England, Russia	antarctic-circle	Geography	In the year 1820, both a British naval commander named Edward Bransfield and a Russian explorer named Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen claimed to have sighted land in the Antarctic region. While there was no way to know the exact nature of the landscape, it was later realized that they had encountered the Antarctic peninsula. This discovery played a key role in the history of Antarctic exploration and helped to expand geographic knowledge of the previously uncharted region.	
diffraction-gratings	1821	Diffraction gratings	Diffraction gratings are optical components used to disperse light into individual colors or wavelengths, which have largely replaced prisms in the study of light spectra. They are essential in the field of spectroscopy for resolving fine details in the spectrum of emitted or reflected light.	Joseph von Fraunhofer	Germany	light-spectrum	Science	Following experiments with light, diffraction gratings were developed as a means to produce more detailed and precise light spectra than what could be achieved with prisms alone. They consisted of fine, parallel lines scratched on glass, which when illuminated by light, produced detailed spectra by diffracting the light at different angles depending on the wavelength.	
electrical-motion	1821	Electrical motion	This discovery laid the foundation for the relationship between electricity and motion, showing how electric currents can produce mechanical movement. The finding was pivotal in developing electromagnetic technology and influenced many future innovations, including electric motors.	Michael Faraday	England	electromagnetism	Science	The discovery of electromagnetism continued to trigger a surge of experimentation, particularly with Michael Faraday's setup of an electrical circuit that included two wires and two magnets. The experimentation showed that when an electric current passed through a wire, it could cause motion in a nearby magnet or wire, thus demonstrating for the first time that electricity can produce mechanical motion in controlled circumstances.	
seebeck-effect	1821	Seebeck effect	The Seebeck effect is the first demonstration of thermoelectricity, generating a voltage difference in a circuit composed of two different metals that are connected at two places with different temperatures. This effect found applications in power generation and temperature measurement	Thomas Johann Seebeck	Germany	electromagnetism	Science	German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered in 1821 that when two different metals were joined at two places and kept at different temperatures, an electric current would be generated. This finding is crucial for understanding thermoelectric effects and is the basis for technologies such as thermocouples and thermoelectric generators.	
glaciers	1821	Glaciers	Venetz suggested that Glaciers must, at some time in the past, have extended far beyond their present limits, explaining why striation patterns resembling glacier movement were found so far from present glaciation.	Ignatz Venetz	Switzerland	popular-mountain-climbing	Geography	The section on Glaciers discusses how these massive ice forms were observed to move like rivers of ice down mountainsides, with geologists also noting striations in rocks caused by their movement. A Swiss geologist published material in 1821 proposing that glaciers once extended much further than they do in modern times; however, the idea did not gain immediate traction.	
fourier-analysis	1822	Fourier analysis	Fourier's theorem outlined the flow of heat and introduced the concept of using sinusoidal components to break down any periodic function, which became the foundation for the field of Fourier analysis. This work significantly advanced the understanding of heat transfer and laid the groundwork for modern signal processing.	Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier	France	calculus	Math	The 1822 publication by French mathematician Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier presented his 'Analytical Theory of Heat', which explained how heat flows using sinusoidal series to express any periodic function. Fourier's work established the technique of dimensional analysis and indicated that the basic set of units should be mass, length, and time, from which other units are derived.	
analytical-engine	1822	Analytical engine	The Analytical Engine was an early mechanical general-purpose computer. It was designed to perform any kind of calculation or logical operation automatically by using punched cards.	Charles Babbage	England	jacquard-loom	Science	Around 1822, Charles Babbage began developing the concept for a machine capable of performing a wide range of calculations by mechanical means, including the use of punched cards. Although a full operational version was never completed in his lifetime, the design of the Analytical Engine laid the groundwork for future computers, being able to perform sequential operations and print results.	
projective-geometry	1822	Projective geometry	Projective geometry is a foundational part of modern geometry dealing with properties and principles that are invariant under projection transformations. Roughly it is the study of the shadows cast by geometric figures.	Jean-Victor Poncelet	France	analytic-geometry	Math	While he was a prisoner of war during Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, Jean-Victor Poncelet reflected on the properties of geometric figures under projection, leading to publications that established the discipline of projective geometry, which studies the relationships between shapes as they appear in perspective or when projected onto various surfaces.	
iguanodon	1822	Iguanodon	The Iguanodon was a significant discovery in paleontology, being a large ancient reptile whose name reflects its iguana-like teeth. As it turned out, this was the first of what would eventually be called dinosaurs.	Gideon Mantell	England		Science	In 1822, Gideon Mantell made a groundbreaking discovery when he identified the bones and teeth resembling those of an iguana, but much larger, which turned out to be from a previously unknown large ancient reptile later named 'Iguanodon'. It was one of the earliest recognitions of what would become classified as dinosaurs.	
hieroglyphics	1822	Hieroglyphics	The decipherment of hieroglyphics by Jean-François Champollion marked a breakthrough in Egyptology, allowing for the interpretation of ancient Egyptian script.	Jean-François Champollion	France	rosetta-stone	Culture	Jean-François Champollion made a monumental stride in 1822 by deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphs, realizing some symbols were alphabetic, some syllabic, and others represented a whole word or idea. This discovery established the field of Egyptology, enabling the interpretation of texts from ancient Egyptian civilization.	
gastric-acidity	1823	Gastric acidity	Prout discovered that stomach hydrochloric acid is part of what permits digestion without harming the stomach lining. This challenged the vitalist theory by showing the presence of such a strong acid within living organisms.	William Prout	England	digestion, acids	Science	In 1823, it was discovered that human stomach secretions contained hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid involved in the digestive process. This acid is part of living beings and aids in digestion without damaging the stomach lining, posing a significant question against the vitalist theory which posited a clear distinction between the chemicals of living organisms and those of nonliving matter.	
platinum-as-catalyst	1823	Platinum as catalyst	Döbereiner discovered that hydrogen gas ignites in the presence of powdered platinum without the platinum being consumed, which laid the groundwork for the idea of metal catalysis in chemical reactions. This led to the innovation of an automatic lighter and has significant implications for industrial chemistry.	Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner	Germany	catalysis	Science	As early as 1816, it had been noted that platinum seemed to help ignite and burn hydrogen more readily, but in 1823, the effect of powdered platinum acting as a catalyst was observed. It was found that the platinum wasn't consumed in the process. Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner's observation of this phenomenon led to further developments in catalysis and the invention of an automatic lighter, propelling the use of catalysts in industrial chemical reactions.	
isomers	1823	Isomers	One chemist studying silver isocyanate, and another studying silver fulminate submitted their findings to a scientific journal whose editor realized that both compounds had the same number of atoms but vastly different properties because of their respective arrangement.	Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig	Germany	atomic-theory	Science	Isomerism was identified as a phenomenon where substances with the same molecular formula possess different chemical properties due to varying arrangements of atoms. This discovery has profound implications in the field of organic chemistry and molecular biology, helping to understand complex molecular structures and their functions.

William Sturgeon	England	simple-electromagnet	Science	An electromagnet was created by insulating an iron bar and winding coiled wire around it. When electricity was introduced, it generated a strong magnetic field, which spurred further innovations in electrical engineering and paved the way for the development of electric motors and generators.	
portland-cement	1824	Portland cement	Portland Cement was superior to previous materials used for the same purpose because it could better withstand the elements. This new formulation involved burning clay and limestone together, and it quickly became fundamental in construction due to its strength and cost-effectiveness	Joseph Aspdin	England	steel, coke-iron	General	In 1824, Portland Cement was invented by an English stonemason, which was superior to previous materials used for the same purpose because it could better withstand the elements. This new formulation involved burning clay and limestone together, and it quickly became fundamental in construction due to its strength and cost-effectiveness.	
steam-engine-efficiency	1824	Steam engine efficiency	The study of steam engine efficiency led to the understanding that the maximum efficiency of a steam engine is governed by the temperature difference between the steam at its hottest and the cold water at its coldest. This work laid the groundwork for thermodynamics and the principles of heat engines.	Nicolas-Léonard-Sadi Carnot	France	improved-steam-engine	Science	In 1824, a book titled 'On the Motive Power of Fire' elaborated on the principles governing steam engine efficiency, revealing that the vast majority of energy from fuel was wasted as heat. The insights gained from this work by a French physicist were critical in paving the way for future advancements in steam engine technology and the broader field of thermodynamics.	
distance-of-the-sun	1824	Distance of the Sun	The distance of the Sun from Earth was recalculated to be 95,300,000 miles, off by only 2.6%	Johann Franz Encke	Germany	mars-distance	Space	Using the transit of Venus to calculate the Sun's parallax, the distance from Earth to the Sun was revised and provided a more accurate measurement than Cassini's prior estimation. This was a significant improvement in astronomical knowledge and helped refine further calculations in celestial mechanics.	
no-quintic-equation	1824	No quintic equation	It was conclusively determined that quintic equations, which are polynomial equations of the fifth degree, cannot be solved by radicals (general solutions using algebraic methods).	Niels Henrik Abel	Norway	cubic-equations,heptadecagon	Math	After prolonged efforts by mathematicians to solve quintic equations, or polynomial equations of the fifth degree, it became clear that these equations could not be solved by radicals. This discovery was an important milestone in the development of algebra and influenced the study of equations and their solvability.

steam-locomotive-improved	1825	Practical steam locomotive	Steam locomotives revolutionized transportation by enabling trains to pull multiple carriages much farther and faster than before, as exemplified by pulling thirty-eight carriages at speeds of 12 to 16 miles per hour.	George Stephenson	England	steam-locomotive	General	In 1825, continued improvements in steam engine technology allowed for a functional and commercially viable steam locomotive that significantly accelerated land transport. For the first time, railways became a practical means for moving goods and people, with speeds comparable to galloping horses, signaling the dawn of modern rail transportation.	
aluminum	1825	Aluminum	The isolation of aluminum marked the beginning of the use of aluminum as a precious material, until a more cost-effective production method was discovered sixty years later.	Hans Christian Ørsted	Denmark	microscope, atomic-weights	Science	The isolation of aluminum was a notable scientific achievement, considering that aluminum is extremely difficult to extract from its compounds. Being the first to isolate aluminum, this discovery laid the groundwork for subsequent research and led to aluminum becoming one of the most widely used metals once a cheaper method of obtaining it in quantity was devised.	
gastric-digestion	1825	Gastric digestion	The study of gastric digestion through observation of a Canadian patient with a unique wound and inch-wide fistula leading into his stomach provided early insights into the digestive process and sparked interest in the field.	William Beaumont	United States	gastric-acidity	Science	Following a gunshot wound that resulted in a fistula, a patient's stomach became accessible for direct observations. This circumstance allowed for unprecedented observation and study of the digestive process in action, which led to greater understanding of digestion and had a significant impact on medical science.	
modern-candles	1825	Modern candles	The development of the modern candle, which was odorless and provided better illumination, improved upon thousands of years of candle usage.	Michel-Eugène Chevreul	France	candle	Science	The invention of the modern candle by the French chemist Chevreul was a significant advancement in the field of illumination.

doppler-effect	1842	Doppler effect	The Doppler Effect is a scientific discovery that explains the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source, noting the change in pitch of a locomotive's whistle as it approaches and then recedes from the observer, as a primary example.	Christian Johann Doppler	Austria	steam-locomotive-improved	Science	The discovery of the Doppler Effect was crucial in understanding how the perceived frequency of a wave, such as sound or light, changes when the source of the wave and the observer move relative to each other. An Austrian physicist named Christian Johann Doppler described this principle, noting the change in pitch of a locomotive's whistle as it approaches and then recedes from the observer, as a primary example. The Doppler Effect helps explain a variety of natural phenomena and has significant implications in areas like astronomy (e.g., redshift) and radar speed detection.	
cranial-index	1842	Cranial Index	Following Blumenbach's idea of races, Retzius suggested a using the ratio of skull width to skull length. An index of less than .8 was called dolichocephalic (long head) and greater was called brachycephalic (broad head). This failed attempt to split the human species into smaller groups only encouraged racism and ethnocentricity.	Anders Adolf Retzius	Sweden	races	Science		
mechanical-equivalent-of-heat	1843	Mechanical equivalent of heat	This concept established the relationship between mechanical work and heat, demonstrating that energy could be converted from one form to another but not created or destroyed. It was a foundational principle in the field of thermodynamics that quantified the amount of work needed to produce a specific quantity of heat.	James Prescott Joule	England	conservation-of-mass	Science	A British physicist decided to explore the relationship between work and heat through extensive experimentation. In 1843, he published findings that quantified the amount of work needed to generate a specific quantity of heat, an effort which established the mechanical equivalent of heat. This principle underpinned the conservation of energy and contributed significantly to the field of thermodynamics.	
sunspot-cycle	1843	Sunspot cycle	The periodic change in the sun's activity, including variations in the number of sunspots and a 10-year cycle (later refined to 11-year on average) was characterized during this time.	Samuel Heinrich Schwabe	Germany	sunspots	Space	While sunspots were initially observed by Galileo, it wasn't until this period that the cyclic nature of sunspot activity began to attract attention. The understanding that sunspots increased and decreased in a somewhat regular cycle imparted vital insights into solar behavior and its potential impact on Earth.	
quaternions	1843	Quaternions	Quaternions are an extension of complex numbers represented as points involving four numbers, which revolutionized three-dimensional computations and physics. They provided a new mathematical framework, paving the way for future developments in algebra and geometry.	William Rowan Hamilton	Ireland	imaginary-numbers	Math	In 1843, it was shown that complex numbers could be treated as points in a plane, and that each could be represented by two numbers. Hamilton tried to deal with hypercomplex numbers that could be represented as points in three or more dimensions and devised quaternions, represented by four numbers.	
higher-analytic-geometry	1843	Higher analytic geometry	Higher analytic geometry is an extension to n-dimensional spaces, providing a fundamental tool in understanding geometric properties and behaviors beyond two and three dimensions. It built upon previous work in analytic geometry and increased the potential for mathematical exploration in multiple dimensions.	Arthur Cayley	England	analytic-geometry, quaternions	Math	In 1843, Cayley worked out analytic geometry in three or more dimensions, which would be called n-dimensional analytic geometry. This was based on extending analytic geometry work in two dimensions, expressed by algebraic equations.	
wheatstone-bridge	1843	Wheatstone bridge	The Wheatstone Bridge (named after its popularizer, not original inventor) is an electrical circuit used to measure unknown electrical resistances with high accuracy. It became a critical instrument in scientific research and electrical engineering.	Charles Wheatstone	England	ohms-law	Design	In 1843, the Wheatstone Bridge, although not invented by Wheatstone himself, garnered recognition when it became popular and widely introduced by him. The Wheatstone bridge measures the resistance of a circuit very delicately by balancing a number of currents against each other.	
transatlantic-liner	1843	Transatlantic liner	The S.S. Great Britain is recognized as the first modern ocean liner, featuring an iron hull and a screw propeller, marking the start of a new era in transatlantic travel. It significantly improved maritime transport efficiency and comfort, influencing future ship design.	Isambard Kingdom Brunel	England	screw-propeller	Design	The first ship seen as a modern transatlantic liner was the S.S. Great Britain, launched on July 19, 1843. It was 322 feet long, had a crew of 130, and featured an iron hull and screw propeller, setting new standards for shipbuilding and transoceanic travel.	
telegraph	1844	Telegraph	The telegraph is a communication system that transmits textual messages through electrical signals over wires. It facilitated rapid long-distance communication and had a significant impact on many aspects of society, including commerce, news dissemination, and military operations.	Samuel Morse	United States	morse-code, electromagnets	Science	In order to maintain the signal over long distances, the telegraph used a relay system invented in 1835. Electricity would pass through a wire, activating an electromagnet to pull on a telegraph key. This action would close a second circuit with its own battery, allowing a strong enough signal to engage another relay and continue the message transmission. Thus, messages could be relayed over vast distances by a network of wires and relays, providing nearly instantaneous communication across extended regions.	
companion-of-sirius	1844	Companion of Sirius	Astronomers discovered a companion star to Sirius, indicating that some stars have dark companions which are not luminous enough to be visible. This discovery suggested that stars can be influenced by gravitational pull from unseen objects, a concept which extended our understanding of stellar systems and their components.	Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel	Germany	stellar-motion, distance-of-stars	Space	The Companion of Sirius refers to the discovery of a star in close proximity to Sirius that followed an irregular path, suggesting the presence of an unseen gravitational influence. Astronomers like Bessel surmised that the erratic motions of certain stars near the end of their lives, such as Sirius and Procyon, indicated they were being influenced by unseen, non-luminous companions—later understood to be white dwarf stars or other dark celestial bodies.	
astraea	1845	Astraea	Astraea is an asteroid discovered after a long systematic search, marking the first newfound asteroid in nearly four decades and rekindling interest in asteroid hunting.	Karl Ludwig Hencke	Germany	asteroids	Space	The German amateur astronomer Karl Ludwig Hencke conducted a systematic search after 1830 and, after fifteen years of failure, discovered the asteroid named Astraea in 1845. This discovery came after a significant hiatus since the discovery of the first four asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta), challenging the assumption that no other asteroids existed.	
spiral-nebulas	1845	Spiral nebulas	Using a telescope with a 72" wide mirror, Parsons observed spiral structures in certain nebulas provided a new understanding of galactic formations and laid the groundwork for future astronomical discoveries.	William Parsons	Ireland	nebular-hypothesis	Space	Before 1845, nebulae in the sky appeared amorphous without discernible structure. However, observations made in 1845, using more advanced telescopes, revealed that some nebulae had spiral structures, a significant breakthrough in astronomy that hinted at the complex composition of distant galaxies.	
permanent-gases	1845	Permanent gases	The term 'permanent gases' was coined for a group of gases that resisted liquefaction under higher pressures, challenging chemists with new boundaries of chemical experimentation.	Michael Faraday	England	liquefying-gases	Science	In 1845, Michael Faraday's experiments to liquefy gases previously thought impossible to liquify, such as oxygen and nitrogen, resulted in the identification of these gases which remained gaseous under the conditions applied. This discovery influenced future research and methods for gas manipulation and contributed to the advancement of physical chemistry.	
anesthesia	1846	Anesthesia	The development of anesthesia involved the use of substances such as ether to induce unconsciousness and sensitize patients for pain-free operations. It revolutionized medicine by allowing more complex and longer surgeries to be performed without causing pain to the patient.	William Thomas Green Morton	United States	chloroform, hypnotism	Science	The development of anesthesia involved the use of substances such as ether to induce unconsciousness and sensitize patients for pain-free operations. While initial experiments were conducted in the 1840s, it wasn't until an American dentist, William Thomas Green Morton, publicly demonstrated the use of ether on a patient in 1846 that the practice was adopted into mainstream medicine.	
neptune	1846	Neptune	Neptune is a distant planet discovered due to irregularities in Uranus's orbit, which suggested the gravitational influence of another planet. It was observed for the first time in 1846, helped by calculations of its possible location due to these perturbations.	John Couch Adams, Urbain-Joseph Le Verrier	England, France	uranus	Space	The planet Uranus was found to have irregularities in its orbit, leading astronomers to predict the presence of Neptune based on gravitational influences on Uranus. Initial predictions were made and refined leading to the eventual observation of the planet in 1846, confirming the existence of the then-unknown planet. Neptune was named after the Roman god of the sea and was significant for showing that objects in our solar system could still be discovered.	
vulcan	1846	Vulcan	Vulcan was a hypothetical planet proposed to exist inside Mercury's orbit to account for peculiarities in Mercury's orbit, suggested by its perihelion shift. The planet was never found and the anomalies in Mercury's remained a mystery for seventy years.	Urbain-Joseph Le Verrier	France	neptune	Space	The search for Vulcan arose from the observation of Mercury's orbit behaving in a way not entirely explained by Newtonian mechanics. The planet Vulcan was postulated to exist closer to the Sun than Mercury. The concept was seriously considered following its proposal, with an aim to seek the planet beginning in 1846, but it was ultimately concluded to not exist after the phenomenon was explained by Einstein's theory.	
crystal-asymmetry	1846	Crystal asymmetry	Molecular asymmetry was discovered as a fundamental characteristic in certain molecules that can cause polarized light to twist in different directions. This discovery laid the groundwork for the field of stereochemistry several decades later.	Louis Pasteur	France	plane-of-polarized-light	Science	In 1846, a breakthrough in understanding molecular structure was achieved when it was found that certain organic molecules called tartarates could twist polarized light clockwise or counterclockwise depending on their asymmetrical structure. The study revealed that two forms of the same substance could have opposite optical effects, which was later understood to be due to the presence of chirality, a concept crucial to stereochemistry.	
protoplasm	1846	Protoplasm	Protoplasm was identified as the vital substance within plant cells responsible for various aspects of life, including growth and development. The discovery of protoplasm enhanced the understanding of the fundamental makeup of cell structure.	Hugo von Mohl	Germany	cell-theory	Science	Hugo von Mohl (1805–1872), a German botanist, discovered that typical plant cells contain a granular colloidal substance, which he termed protoplasm in 1846. This material, which comprises the living part of the cell, was recognized for its essential role in cell function, representing a significant advancement in cell biology and physiology.	
cuneiform-decipherment	1846	Cuneiform decipherment	The decipherment of cuneiform script opened up understanding of ancient Mesopotamian cultures, providing insight into their language, history, and civilization. This linguistic breakthrough enabled the translation of countless tablets and inscribed artifacts.	Henry Rawlinson	England	rosetta-stone	Geography	In the 19th century, cuneiform, an ancient writing system used in Mesopotamia, was deciphered by linguists and archaeologists. Henry Rawlinson, a British army officer and scholar, played a pivotal role in this achievement, leading to a significant expansion of knowledge about early human civilizations.	
sewing-machine	1846	Sewing machine	The sewing machine was devised to make a device small enough for the home that could sew stitches using a needle and a shuttle. It revolutionized home and industrial sewing, greatly reducing the time and effort required for creating garments.	Elias Howe	United States	jacquard-loom	Design	Prior to the invention of the sewing machine, weaving machines for cloth patterns existed, but there was a need for a more compact and convenient device for use in the home. The first successful model that caught on used a needle and shuttle to create stitches and outperformed manual sewing methods, hence gaining popularity and becoming a key product of the Industrial Revolution that eased household sewing tasks.	
conservation-of-energy	1847	Conservation of energy	This fundamental principle states that the total amount of energy in the Universe is constant, where energy cannot be created or destroyed but can change forms, such as between mechanical, electrical, and chemical energies. The law signifies a foundational concept in the field of physics and underscores the interconvertibility of various forms of energy.	Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz	Germany	mechanical-equivalent-of-heat	Science	The law of conservation of energy, proposed in the mid-19th century, asserts that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant over time. It indicates that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transferred or transformed from one form to another. This principle has become a cornerstone of physics, guiding the understanding of energy dynamics across all natural processes.	
puerperal-fever	1847	Puerperal fever	Puerperal fever is an infection that historically affected childbearing women, often leading to severe illness and death, and it was discovered that cross-contamination from doctors treating multiple patients could exacerbate the spread of the disease. The recognition of this contagious nature of the fever prompted improved sanitary practices in medical care.	Ignaz Phillipp Semmelweiss 	Hungary	pathology	Science	The recognition of puerperal fever, or childbed fever, as a contagious condition marked an important step in medical science, emphasizing the importance of hygiene and sanitation in the prevention of the spread of infections. This discovery led to the understanding that doctors could inadvertently transfer bacteria from one patient to another, influencing the development of antiseptic techniques and a shift toward better sanitary practices in hospitals and childbirth procedures.	
painless-childbirth	1847	Painless childbirth	The invention allowed for painless childbirth by using a certain anesthesia, which was a groundbreaking advancement for obstetrics.	James Young Simpson	England	anesthesia, puerperal-fever	Science	A British obstetrician discovered the ability to administer anaesthesia to women in childbirth, providing a much less dangerous and traumatic experience than the prevalent methods at the time. This practice was adopted quickly and became a transformative development for both healthcare providers and expectant mothers.	
nitroglycerine	1847	Nitroglycerine	Initially discovered by accidentally mixing nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table, nitroglycerine was further improved and stabilized to be used in construction and warfare, hence beginning the modern era of explosives.	Christian Friedrich Schönbein	Germany	gunpowder	Science	Initially discovered by Christian Friedrich Schönbein when he accidentally created a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table, nitroglycerine was further improved and stabilized to be used in construction and warfare, hence beginning the modern era of explosives.	
symbolic-logic	1847	Symbolic logic	Symbolic Logic is a system that leverages symbols and operations analogous to algebra to represent and solve logical arguments. Its development has essential applications in areas such as mathematics and computer programming.	George Boole	England	calculus	Math	In 1847, George Boole published 'The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,' formulating a system that applies a set of symbols to logical operations. This method resembles algebra, allowing logical arguments to be manipulated and solved symbolically, which laid the groundwork for later developments in mathematics and computer science.	
silver-fillings	1847	Silver fillings	Silver fillings are a dental innovation enabling the restoration of teeth damaged by decay. This technique involves filling the cavities with silver amalgam to prevent further deterioration.	Thomas Wilberger Evans	United States	dentistry	Science	Thomas Wilberger Evans introduced the use of silver amalgam for fillings in 1847. This method restored teeth that had cavities due to decay, offering a durable solution for maintaining dental health.	
absolute-zero	1848	Absolute zero	Absolute Zero is the theoretical lowest temperature possible, where gas volume decreases to zero and all thermal motion ceases. The Kelvin scale measures the Celsius degree of heat that the freezing point of water would be 273.15 K, and it has since been essential in thermodynamics for providing an absolute scale.	Baron Kelvin	England	gas-volume-temperature, celsius	Science	British physicist William Thomson, later known as Baron Kelvin, pointed out in 1848 the significance of energy loss affecting not only gases but also liquids and solids. The concept of Absolute Zero reflects a state where temperature can be indefinitely lowered, and all kinetic activity halts, leading to the Kelvin scale of temperature.	
crab-nebula	1848	Crab Nebula	Using large new telescopes, the Crab Nebula was identified as a remnant of a bright new star first observed in 1054. It was noted for its irregular shape resembling a crab. Its study has been instrumental in astronomical research and has solidified the importance of the event it represents in history.	Lord Rosse	England	spiral-nebulas	Space	In 1848, using a giant telescope, Lord Rosse studied the first nebulosity (M1) on the list Messier had prepared since 1771. He observed a patch of a curiously irregular shape that seemed to have numerous crooked legs like those of a crab, leading him to call it the 'Crab nebula'—a name that has been preserved. This marked an important step in understanding the remnants of supernovas and their role in the cosmos.	
spectral-line-shift	1848	Spectral line shift	The spectral line shift or Doppler-Fizeau effect describes the change in wavelength and frequency of light from a source due to its relative motion, which impacts the study of motion and velocity in astronomy. The red shift indicates objects in space receding from the viewer, while the blue shift suggests an approaching motion.	Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau	France	doppler-effect	Science	Building on the Doppler effect with respect to sound that had been described in 1842, physicist Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau proposed in 1848 that the concept could be applied to the waves of light as well. This shift in light's spectral lines could show a shift towards red if the light source is receding or a shift towards blue in case of an approaching light source, enabling better understanding of the universe's expansion and motion of celestial bodies.	
speed-of-light-experiment	1849	Speed of light experiment	The speed of light was determined more accurately using an earthbound experiment involving a toothed wheel and mirrors. Foucault's best figure was off by just 0.7 percent. He also found that light traveling through water traveled only three-fourths as fast as through air.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	speed-of-light, aberration-light, spectral-line-shift	Science	Using an improved method involving a toothed wheel and two mirrors, one stationary and the other rotating, scientists were able to measure the speed of light with increased precision. Light was reflected from the stationary mirror to the rotating one and the timing of the reflection was measured, which allowed for a more accurate speed of light calculation.	
roche-limit	1849	Roche limit	The Roche limit refers to the critical distance within which celestial bodies, like Saturn's rings, would disintegrate due to tidal forces rather than accrete into a larger body due to gravitational attraction. This concept explains why certain astronomical bodies form rings instead of coalescing into moons or planets.	Edouard Roche	France	universal-gravitation, saturn-rings	Space	The Roche Limit is a concept in celestial mechanics introduced in 1849. It addresses the effect of tidal forces on an object when it is in a close orbital proximity to a larger body, such as a planet. If an object, such as a satellite or ring particle, orbits within this limit, tidal forces overcome the gravitational forces holding it together, and it may break up and disperse, often forming rings rather than a single body. The Roche Limit has helped to understand the formation and nature of rings around planets like Saturn.	
nerve-fibers	1849	Nerve fibers	Discovery that nerve fibers are prolonged outgrowths of cells strengthened the cell theory, highlighting the direct extension of cells in the formation of nerves. This finding contributed significantly to the understanding of the nervous system structure.	Rudolf Albert von Kölliker	Germany	cell-theory	Science	In 1849, it was revealed that nerve fibers are actually elongated outgrowths of cells. This discovery was pivotal as it supported and reinforced the developing cell theory, illustrating that not only do cells serve as the fundamental units of life, they also directly extend to form more complex structures such as the nerves in the nervous system. Prior to this, the composition of nerves and how they related to cells were not fully understood.	
safety-pin	1849	Safety Pin	Improved pin design included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place.	Walter Hunt	United States	steel	Design		
reinforced-concrete	1849	Reinforced Concrete	Monier, a commercial gardener, experimented with iron-wire reinforcement for his cement and concrete tubs and basins, making it much stronger.	Joseph Monier	France	steel	Design		
second-law-of-thermodynamics	1850	Second law of thermodynamics	The Second Law of Thermodynamics formalizes the observation that energy in a closed system tends to become less useful over time, a concept also known as entropy. This principle is fundamental in predicting the direction of natural processes and understanding the limits of energy conversion and work.	Rudolf Clausius	Germany	conservation-of-energy, steam-engine-efficiency, thermochemistry	Science	After the establishment of the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is the law of conservation of energy, the Second Law points out that in any closed system, no energy can be destroyed, but it tends to be spread out and degraded over time, leaving less and less energy in a useful form. German physicist Rudolf Clausius, and later, physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, contributed to refining this concept, stating that while energy remains constant, the entropy of the universe always increases, leading to a gradual decay of available energy for doing work.	
infrared-waves	1850	Infrared waves	The discovery of infrared waves unveiled a type of radiation beyond the visible spectrum, detectable due to its heating effects and possessing similar wave properties as visible light. This discovery broadened the understanding of electromagnetic radiation and led to the development of various applications utilizing infrared technology.	Macedonio Melloni	Italy	infrared-radiation	Science	Infrared waves were discovered as a form of light that lies outside the visible spectrum, characterized by longer wavelengths that can cause heating effects and are detectable by sensitive instruments. The detection and study of infrared radiation opened new avenues in scientific research and practical applications, such as thermal imaging and remote sensing.	
rotation-of-the-earth	1851	Rotation of the earth	Ever since the time of Copernicus, it had been assumed that the Earth rotates on its axis, but no one had proven it. Foucault suspended a large iron ball inside the dome of a large church. The pendulum ended in a spike that would mark the floor as it swung, showing the changing orientation of the swing.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	heliocentric-practice	Science	Ever since the time of Copernicus, it had been assumed that the Earth rotates on its axis, but no one had proven it. In 1851, Foucault suspended a large iron ball inside the dome of a large church. The pendulum ended in a spike that would mark the floor as it swung, demonstrating Earth's rotation by the changing orientation of the pendulum's swing. The experiment showed that in Paris, it would take 31 hours and 47 minutes for the pendulum to complete a full rotation, visually proving Earth's rotation to observers.	
ariel-and-umbriel	1851	Ariel and umbriel	Lassell discovered a third and fourth satellite of Uranus, naming them after spirits in English literature (Shakespeare and Pope).	William Lassell	England	uranus-satellites	Space	The last large satellite, Triton, had been discovered five years before 1851, but there were smaller satellites to be found. In 1848, Lassell had discovered an eighth satellite of Saturn named Hyperion. The year 1851 saw the discovery of two more satellites by an American astronomer, Ariel and Umbriel, adding to the growing knowledge of planetary satellites.	
joule-thomson-effect	1852	Joule-thomson effect	The Joule-Thomson effect demonstrated how a gas cools when it expands if kept insulated from external energy sources. This effect later facilitated the liquefaction of permanent gases.	James Prescott Joule and William Thomson	England	second-law-of-thermodynamics	Science	In 1852, Joule and Thomson were able to show that if a gas was allowed to expand, it consumed energy, because the molecules had to separate against a certain tendency to cling together. If energy were kept from entering the gas, the energy for expansion would have to come from the gas itself, and the temperature would drop. This came to be called the Joule-Thomson effect and would later be used to liquefy some of the permanent gases.	
valence-theory	1852	Valence theory	The valence theory explained how elements combine with fixed numbers of other atoms according to specific rules. The notion of valence imposed a new kind of order on the elements, because valence seemed to change regularly with the arrangement of atoms in the periodic table.	Edward Frankland	England	atomic-theory	Science	Chemists knew that elements had different capacities for combining with other elements. For instance, an oxygen atom would combine with two hydrogen atoms to form water, a nitrogen atom would combine with three hydrogen atoms to form ammonia, and a carbon atom would combine with four hydrogen atoms to form methane. This was not studied closely and systematically, however, until an English chemist, Edward Frankland, studied organometallic compounds. He could not help noticing the manner in which metallic atoms combined with organic compounds, and how each different kind of atom would almost invariably hook onto a fixed number of other atom groupings. In 1852 he published his theory of what came to be called valence, pointing out that a particular atom had the power to combine with fixed numbers of other kinds of atoms according to simple rules. The notion of valence imposed a new kind of order on the elements, because valence seemed to change regularly with the arrangement of atoms in the periodic table.	
gyroscope	1852	Gyroscope	A massive rotating sphere that maintains its axis of spin direction, used for steady navigation. It provided a more reliable means of indicating true north than the magnetic compass.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	rotation-of-the-earth, compass	Science	A demonstration was made with a heavy rim (a gyroscope) set to rapid rotation. It maintained its axial direction even when tipped, counteracting gravity to maintain steady orientation, thus substituting the magnetic compass for accurate navigation.	
sunspots-and-earth	1852	Sunspots and earth	The discovery linked disturbances in Earth's magnetic field with the increase and decrease of sunspots on the Sun. This finding was pivotal in showing that Earth's magnetic properties were influenced by solar activity.	Edward Sabine	England	earth-magnet, sunspot-cycle	Space	Research demonstrated that the frequency of disturbances in Earth's magnetic field paralleled the increase and decrease of sunspots. It established the first known connection between Earth and Sun involving something other than light, heat, or gravitational pull, indicating that sunspots had magnetic properties.	
elevators	1852	Elevators	The invention of the mechanical elevator with a safety guard revolutionized urban architecture by allowing buildings to rise to greater heights. This innovation enabled the construction of skyscrapers and transformed city landscapes.	Elisha Graves Otis	United States	reinforced-concrete	Design	Spearheading the creation of an elevator with an adequate safety guard, the device prevented the elevator from falling if its supporting cable severed. A public demonstration in 1854 showed the inventor safely ascending and descending after cutting the cable, proving the system's safety and functionality.	
age-of-the-sun	1853	Age of the sun	The Sun's energy source was identified as gravitational collapse rather than combustion, leading to the conclusion that the Sun is millions of years old and will eventually become too cool to support life on Earth. This challenged the belief that the Sun was eternal and suggested that Earth is much older than previously believed.	Hermann von Helmholtz	Germany	conservation-of-energy, biblical-age-of-earth	Space	It had been assumed for thousands of years that the Sun was eternal, unchanged, and only God could end it. The discovery of sunspots began to question this belief. With the law of conservation of energy established, scientists queried how the Sun could shine brilliantly for millions of years. Helmholtz proposed gravitational contraction as the energy source. This implied that the Sun had been gradually contracting for about twenty-five million years, and in another ten million years, it would be too small and cool to support life, indicating that the Earth is much older than twenty-five million years.	
glider	1853	Glider	Cayley created the first glider capable of sustaining flight through wind and updrafts. He forced his coachman take the first flight, flying 500 yards and surviving. This laid the foundation for the development of airplanes.	George Cayley	England	aerodynamics, hot-air-balloon	Science: Physics	Balloons existed for seventy years, showing that objects heavier than air could stay aloft under certain conditions. George Cayley scientifically studied these conditions, founding the science of aerodynamics. He discovered that fixed wings, like those on squirrels, were needed for flight, along with innovations in design including wings, tail, streamlined fuselage, and rudder. Realizing a suitable engine for powered flight wasn't yet available, he constructed a first glider in 1853, capable of gliding with wind and updrafts.	
kerosene	1853	Kerosene	A novel process to yield an inflammable liquid from asphalt became vital for lamps. It was crucial for illumination in Europe and America despite the challenge of producing sufficient quantities.	Abraham Gesner	Canada	gas-lighting	Science:Chemistry	In 1853 a British physician, Abraham Gesner, developed a process that would yield an inflammable liquid from asphalt. Because it was driven out of a waxy mixture of solid hydrocarbons, Gesner called the liquid kerosene, from a Greek word for 'wax.' Kerosene proved ideal for lamps, but even with Gesner’s process, enough kerosene could not be produced to meet the great demands represented by the lamps of Europe and America.	
cholera	1854	Cholera	Through studying a cholera epidemic, Snow identified contaminated water as the source of the Cholera disease, shaping future concepts of epidemiology and public health sanitation.	John Snow	England		Science:Medicine	In the early nineteenth century, Europe suffered from several cholera epidemics that arrived from India, where it was endemic. Increasingly, physicians were sure that the contagion arose from polluted water. An English physician, John Snow, had published his views on this matter in 1849. When an epidemic of cholera struck London in 1854, Snow studied the geographic incidence of cholera in relation to water supply. He found five hundred cases of cholera, for instance, within a few blocks of a public water pump that drew water from a well just a few feet from a sewer pipe. He had the pump handle removed, and	
telegraph-plateau	1854	Telegraph plateau	Laying cables across the Atlantic Ocean to connect Europe and America necessitated understanding the ocean floor. American oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury identified a central plateau, naming it the Telegraph Plateau, essential for cable laying.	Matthew Fontaine Maury	England	ocean-navigation, telegraph	Geography	With cables laid across the Hudson and Mississippi rivers in the 1840s and under the English Channel and the Irish Sea in the 1850s, it became natural to think of a real job, that of laying a cable under the Atlantic Ocean to connect Europe and America. The process of laying such a cable required some understanding of what the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was like, and the task fell to the American oceanographer Maury. In the early 1850s he had prepared a chart of ocean depths, and by 1854 he had noted that the Atlantic Ocean was shallower in the center than on either side. He concluded that there was a central plateau, which he called Telegraph Plateau.	
riemann-geometry	1854	Riemann geometry	Riemann generalized geometry to work with any number of dimensions, building on Lobachevsky and Bolay. He created self-consistent models where all lines intersect and all lines are finite in length, extending geometry's scope beyond traditional Euclidean limitations. 	Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann	Germany	non-euclidean-geometry	Math:Geometry	The non-Euclidean geometry worked out by Lobachevsky and Bolyai presupposed the possibility of more than one line through a point, all parallel to a given line that did not include the point. As in Euclidean geometry, lines of infinite length were possible. In 1854 a German mathematician, Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, developed another kind of non-Euclidean geometry, one in which it was impossible for any two lines to be parallel, and all lines intersected. In this geometry all lines were finite in length. In Euclidean geometry, the three angles of a triangle add up to 360 degrees; in Lobachevskian geometry, they add up to less than 360 degrees; and in Riemannian geometry, they add up to more than 360 degrees. Riemann's geometry is perfectly reasonable and self-consistent. He generalized geometry to the point where he considered it in any number of dimensions. He also considered situations in which measurements changed from point to point in space but in such a way that one could transform one set of measurements into another according to a fixed rule. At the time, this sounded like pure abstraction, but half a century later, Riemannian geometry was shown to represent a truer picture of the Universe than did Euclid's geometry, thanks to the theory of general relativity.	
lines-of-force	1855	Lines of force	Faraday introduced the concept of lines of force but knowing no math could only describe it pictorally. Maxwell translated it into mathematical form.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	electric-generators	Science:Physics	Faraday introduced the concept of lines of force, which he could only describe pictorially due to a lack of mathematical knowledge. In 1855, British mathematician James Clerk Maxwell managed to translate this concept into a mathematical form, demonstrating that Faraday's intuitive grasp of the subject was accurate.	
geissler-tubes	1855	Geissler tubes	The invention introduced improved vacuum tubes which led to advances in studying atomic structures. Utilizing mercury columns to create a superior vacuum, these tubes were more effectively evacuated compared to prior versions.	Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler	Germany	barometer	Science:Physics	Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler designed an air pump that did not require mechanical parts, using a mercury column to create a vacuum. These Geissler tubes were significantly more evacuated and transparent, aiding in future atomic structure studies.	
seismograph	1855	Seismograph	The first crude seismograph was invented to detect small tremors using horizontal tubes partly filled with mercury. Although not highly effective initially, it marked the beginning of earthquake monitoring equipment.	Luigi Palmieri	Italy	earthquakes	Science:Geology	Luigi Palmieri invented the initial seismograph to detect minor earthquakes. It used horizontal tubes turned up at the ends and correctly filled with mercury; small iron floats would move with the tremors, allowing an estimate of their scale and intensity.	
pyroxylin	1855	Pyroxylin	A British chemist discovered that pyroxilin, if dissolved in alcohol, ether and camphor, would produce a hard solid upon evaporation. He found no practical application of this, but discovered the first synthetic plastic.	Alexander Parkes	England	cellulose	Science:Chemistry	Alexander Parkes discovered pyroxylin, a chemical compound that was instrumental in the development of new materials. This compound would later lead to the creation of celluloid, a precursor to modern plastics.	
glycogen	1856	Glycogen	Glycogen is a form of starch discovered in the mammalian liver that is easily broken down into glucose. This discovery showed that both plants and animals build up and break down complex molecules for energy storage and usage.	Claude Bernard	France	diabetes	Science:BiologyUntil now, starch had been viewed as the plant's way of storing energy. Animals tend to store it as fat (as some plants do too), which is a more compact form of energy. In 1856, however, the French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813–1878) discovered a form of starch in the mammalian liver. Because it was easily broken down to glucose (the immediate energy source in the bloodstream), he called it glycogen (Greek for 'glucose-producer'). He showed that glycogen was built up out of blood glucose and acted as a reserve store that could be broken down to glucose again when necessary. Whether glycogen was built up or broken down depended on the exact state of the body, the energy requirements of the various tissues, the food supply in the intestines, and so on. The net result was that the glycogen balance was so maneuvered that the sugar content in the blood remained steady. Until then, it was supposed that plants built up complex molecules (anabolism) and that animals tore them down (catabolism). Bernard's work showed that animals built up complex molecules as well, and as time went on, it appeared that both plants and animals built up and broke down substances as needed. What was different between them was that the build-up in plants was through solar energy, while in animals, the build-up was through chemical energy from food, the food being obtained eventually if not directly, from plants.		
bessemer-steel	1856	Bessemer steel	A new steel making process allowed for the removal of excess carbon in cast iron, creating tough, hard steel more cheaply. This innovation paved the way for the construction of infrastructure such as buildings and elevators in the next century.	Henry Bessemer	England	coke-iron, oxygen	Science:Metallurgy	The Bessemer process involves burning off carbon from cast iron more cheaply by using a blast of air through molten iron. By optimizing the combination of oxygen from the air and carbon in the iron, this method allowed for the economical production of durable steel, which was essential for building the cities of the future.	
synthetic-dyes	1856	Synthetic dyes	Attempting to synthesize quinine, an accidental creation of synthetic dyes revolutionized the textile industry by providing a wide array of colors that were previously difficult to achieve. 	William Henry Perkin	England	dye, quinine	Science:Chemistry	William Henry Perkin accidentally discovered mauve dye while attempting to synthesize quinine. This innovation led him to establish a dye manufacturing industry, which met great commercial success and transformed the world of fashion with synthetic colors.	
neanderthal-man	1856	Neanderthal man	The discovery of Neanderthal bones in Neander Valley in Germany provided key insights into human evolution. This finding helped establish the understanding that humans have ancient origins and are part of a long lineage.	Pierre-Paul Broca	France	biblical-age-of-earth	Science:Archaeology	In Neander Valley, Germany, workers found ancient bones, including a skull, which were identified by a professor at a nearby school. This significant discovery contributed to the fields of geology and biology, confirming the ancient age of Earth and early human ancestors.	
pasteurization	1856	Pasteurization	Pasteurization is a process that heats liquids to a specific temperature to kill harmful microorganisms, preventing spoilage and disease. It revolutionized the wine industry and later the dairy industry by making products safer for consumption.	Louis Pasteur	France	fermentation, microorganisms	Science:Microbiology	French wine was turning sour as it aged, causing significant losses. Through his research, Pasteur found that wine contained different types of yeast cells, and by heating the wine to about 50°C, he could kill the yeast cells without affecting the wine's taste. This method, called pasteurization, was eventually applied to milk to prevent the spread of diseases caused by contaminated dairy products. It had a significant impact on food safety and led to further advancements in microbiology.	
saturns-rings-composition	1857	Saturn's rings composition	Saturn's rings were hypothesized to be composed of myriad small particles. Maxwell confirmed this using Roche's limit, solidifying the theory.	James Clerk Maxwell	Scotland	roche-limit	Space	By this time, it seemed very likely that Saturn's rings were composed of myriads of small particles. Since they were inside Roche's limit, solid particles would break up under tidal influences and be unable to coalesce again. In 1857, Maxwell showed that this was indeed so, based on purely theoretical considerations, and no one has doubted it since.	
evolution-by-natural-selection	1858	Evolution by natural selection	Natural selection explained how some species evolve into other related species while others become extinct, driven by the competition for survival. This theory posited that nature selects the fittest individuals to survive and pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring.	Charles Robert Darwin	England	population-growth-theory	Science:Biology	The British biologist Charles Robert Darwin believed that life forms had evolved; that some species, with time, changed into other related species, while some species became extinct. Darwin theorized that not only human beings multiplied past the food supply available, but that all living things did. Therefore, in each generation, there was a competition for survival among the too-many, and those tended to survive who could snatch enough food, or best evade a predator. In short, nature itself would select a few from the many for survival. The characteristics that made survival likely would be inherited by the offspring of the survivors and again there would be a natural selection. Darwin assumed that there were always variations among offspring, random and tiny variations perhaps, and that nature then used those variations as a means of selection, so to speak. The 'better' among the variations would not always do better, since there was always the factor of chance, but on the whole, and in the long run, they would.	
organic-molecular-structure	1858	Organic molecular structure	A major advancement in understanding molecular structure, highlighting the arrangement of atoms within compounds using the concept of valence. This system introduced notation: Water would be H—O—H, and carbon dioxide O=C=O, clarifying the organization of organic molecules, resolving many mysteries of organic chemistry.	August Kekulé	Germany	valence-theory	Science:Chemistry	Until this point, organic molecules were characterized solely by the number of atoms of each element present. Even with isomers showing identical atom counts but different properties, it was unclear how to distinguish these differences. Friedrich August Kekulé expanded on Frankland's idea of valence, illustrating how each hydrogen atom could bond to others and how atoms within molecules can form complex structures by latching onto valence bonds. This led to the clarification of organic molecules' structures and the resolution of many mysteries in organic chemistry.	
cellular-pathology	1858	Cellular pathology	Further development of cell theory, emphasizing the importance of cells in pathology. This advancement strengthened the concept that all diseases involve changes at the cellular level, and opposed the idea of spontaneous generation.	Rudolph Virchow	Germany	cell-theory, pathology, no-spontaneous-generation-redux	Science:Biology	Building on the cell theory, which emerged in 1838, Rudolph Virchow continued to refine our understanding of pathology by stressing that all diseases are manifestations of changes in cells. This insight provided a crucial framework for modern medical practices, making it possible to relate clinical symptoms and pathological findings to cellular alterations.	
refrigerators	1858	Refrigerators	Refrigerators are devices that lower temperatures to keep food from spoiling by using the principle of evaporative cooling. They evolved from bulky and inconvenient devices into almost universal household appliances over approximately seventy-five years.	Ferdinand Carré	France	liquefying-gases	General	Reducing food to a low temperature kept it from spoiling, and in early times, natural ice was used for the purpose. In the early nineteenth century, mechanical refrigerators were developed by liquefying gases to lower temperature and condensing them to pump out heat. Ferdinand Carré designed the first successful commercial refrigerator in 1858 using water; he switched to ammonia in 1859 which was more efficient. Though initially used industrially for ice-making and meat-packing, they eventually became convenient for household use after extensive improvements.	
electricity-in-a-vacuum	1858	Electricity in a vacuum	The study of electricity in a vacuum involves observing electric currents in evacuated vessels, leading to the discovery of fluorescence in a Geissler tube. This phenomenon, characterized by a greenish glow, resulted from the energetic collision of radiation with matter.	Julius Plücker	Germany	geissler-tubes, electrical-motion	Science:Physics	Occasionally, scientists attempted to force an electric current through a vacuum to study the electric fluid without interference. The phenomenon of fluorescence was first observed by Gabriel Stokes when an electric current was passed through vacuum-enclosed glass vessels. In 1858, Julius Plücker forced an electric current through a Geissler tube and observed the glowing fluorescence, which shifted due to an electromagnetic field. This discovery helped further the understanding of vacuums and electric currents.	
oil-wells	1859	Oil wells	This invention marked the first instance of drilling for oil, which was sometimes found on the surface, leading to the mass production of kerosene and other petroleum products. It utilized a method previously applied to brine drilling, significantly boosting oil availability and impacting various industries.	Edwin Laurentine Drake	United States	kerosene, oil-lamp	Science:Geology	Petroleum, a complex mixture of hydrocarbons from microorganisms' fat content, was previously extracted from the surface. It was discovered that drilling could access deeper, untapped reserves. Edwin Laurentine Drake utilized a method from brine drilling and drilled the first successful oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. This discovery led to the mass production of kerosene and spurred further oil drilling.	
storage-battery	1859	Storage battery	A reversible chemical reaction allowed rechargeable batteries to store electric current after being depleted. This invention provided a way to repeatedly charge and use batteries for electric power storage, paving the path for more efficient energy usage and storage solutions.	Gaston Planté	France	electric-battery	Science:Physics	All the electric batteries used in the six decades since Volta had invented the first one were one-shot affairs. The chemical reaction that gave rise to the electric current eventually proceeded to a point where it could no longer support current. It then had to be discarded, for the chemical reaction could not be reversed. Yet some chemical reactions are easily reversible. In 1859, a French physicist, Gaston Planté (1834-1889), took two sheets of lead, with an insulating sheet of rubber between them, rolled the lead sheets into a spiral, and upended it into dilute sulfuric acid. He found that a chemical reaction resulted that would produce an electric current. Furthermore, when the battery was discharged, an electric current could be forced through it in the opposite direction, and the chemical reaction would be reversed, so that the battery could eventually produce an electric current again. Naturally, we are not getting something for nothing. The second law of thermodynamics (see 1850) would not allow that. The electrical energy required to charge a storage battery is always greater than the amount it can then deliver. It would be a losing proposition, therefore, to charge a discharged storage battery from one that was fully charged. To charge a storage battery, you must get your electricity from a generator that makes use of fuel energy or some other nonelectrical source of energy.	
spectral-lines-and-elements	1859	Spectral lines and elements	Since their discovery by Fraunhofer nearly half a century before, spectral lines had not been connected with chemistry. The discovery that each element produces characteristic spectral lines when heated extended knowledge about chemical elements and their behaviors. This finding allowed for the identification of elements through their unique spectral fingerprints.	Gustav Robert Kirchhoff	Germany	spectral-lines	Science:Chemistry	Since their discovery by Fraunhofer nearly half a century before, spectral lines had not been connected with chemistry. The German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), however, had carefully studied the spectra of light produced when various elements were heated to incandescence. He found that each element produced light of only certain wavelengths, so that the spectrum consisted sometimes of only a few lines of light, which were sometimes well separated. In 1859 Kirchhoff announced that every element produced characteristic spectral lines, which it also absorbed when its vapors were cooler than the light source. The pattern of lines was different for each element; no two elements shared spectral lines in exactly the same positions. In essence, each element had a spectral 'fingerprint.' This meant that if any sample of ore, on being heated to incandescence, produced even a single spectral line in a position not recorded for any known element, then some new element must be present in that ore. Making use of such spectroscopic data, Kirchhoff discovered cesium in 1860. The name is derived from the Latin word for 'sky-blue,' since that was the color of the spectral line that had given away cesium's existence. The next year Kirchhoff discovered rubidium, a related element, its name coming from the Latin for 'red.' Kirchhoff also pointed out that the dark lines in the solar spectrum were the result of light being absorbed by the gases in the sun.	
solar-flares	1859	Solar flares	An astronomical observation identified solar flares, which are brief but violent explosions associated with sunspots. This discovery enhanced understanding of the Sun's activity, distinguishing between periods of high and low sunspot activity.	Richard Christopher Carrington	England	sunspot-cycle	Space	The British astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington observed the Sun's rotation by measuring sunspots. He noticed a bright point of light that lasted for five minutes and then subsided, which he initially speculated to be a falling meteor but later realized was a solar flare. This observation linked sunspots with solar flares and marked the understanding of 'active' and 'quiet' phases of the Sun based on sunspot activity.	
kinetic-theory-of-gases	1859	Kinetic theory of gases	Maxwell described the behavior of gases based on the movement and velocity distribution of their molecules. It provided a statistical approach to understanding how gas molecules behave differently depending on temperature and velocity, revolutionizing thermodynamics.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	boyles-law, thermochemistry, charles-law	Science:Physics	James Clerk Maxwell worked on mathematical relationships describing how the molecules of a gas move randomly at different speeds and bounce off walls with perfect elasticity. He discovered that the distribution of molecular velocities could be linked to the temperature and that gases can exhibit statistically significant deviations from expected behavior. This indicated that gases could sometimes defy the second law of thermodynamics, challenging existing theories.	
spontaneous-generation-rip	1860	Spontaneous generation R. I. P.	Pasteur's experiment conclusively demonstrated that life does not spontaneously arise from non-living matter. This was the nail in the coffin for the concept of spontaneous generation.	Louis Pasteur	France	no-spontaneous-generation-redux	Science:BiologyPasteur boiled meat extract and placed it in a flask with a long, curved neck that allowed air to enter but prevented dust particles from falling in. The meat extract did not spoil or develop microorganisms, disproving the theory of spontaneous generation and suggesting that dust carries microorganisms.		
internal-combustion-engine	1860	Internal-combustion engine	Instead of using steam to move a piston, what if flammable vapor and air could explode within a cylinder to move the piston instead? Although still too inefficient to be practical, this engine powered small vehicles and represented a significant step in the evolution of modern transportation.	Jean-Joseph-Étienne Lenoir	France	kinetic-theory-of-gases, steam-engine-efficiency	Design	Prior to the internal-combustion engine, steam engines were the primary source of mechanical power. Lenoir's invention harnessed the explosive force of flammable vapor mixed with air within a cylinder to move a piston directly. This compact and responsive engine was the precursor to the efficient internal-combustion engines that came thereafter, enabling the creation of horseless carriages and ultimately revolutionizing transportation.	
organic-synthesis	1860	Organic synthesis	Berthelot was able to synthesize organic molecules in a lab without the use of living matter. This advancement supported the development of organic chemistry and debunked the idea that only living tissue could manufacture complex organic molecules.	Pierre-Eugène-Marcelin Berthelot	France	synthetic-urea	Science: Chemistry	When Wöhler synthesized urea, it challenged the notion that complex organic molecules could only be produced by living organisms. Pierre-Eugène-Marcelin Berthelot furthered this field by synthesizing important organic compounds such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, methane, benzene, and acetylene by 1860. This led to the realization that the chemical structures and properties of organic molecules could be replicated outside of living systems, aiding the progression of organic chemistry.	
solar-prominences	1860	Solar prominences	Advancements in astronomical photography allowed for the detailed capture of solar phenomena. This included solar prominences which are gouts of flame around the edge of the sun during a total eclipse. This was the first astronomical discovery made as a result of photography, and required de la Rue to quickly travel to Spain.	Warren de la Rue	England	reflecting-telescope, photography, solar-flares, steam-locomotive-improved	Space	Through the use of a specially adapted telescope, the English astronomer Warren de la Rue excelled in photographing the Sun's phenomena. In 1860 during a trip to Spain, he captured an image of a total solar eclipse that clearly showed flame-like prominences extending from the sun. These images provided valuable insights into solar behavior and greatly improved the understanding of solar prominences.	
avogadro-revived	1860	Avogadro's hypothesis revived	Avogadro's hypothesis, revived by Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro, clarified that the molecular weight of gases can be determined with certainty, resolving much confusion in molecular structure.	Stanislao Cannizzaro	Italy	avogadro-hypothesis, organic-molecular-structure	Science:Chemistry	Avogadro's hypothesis, revived by Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro, clarified that the molecular weight of gases can be determined, resolving much confusion in molecular structure. Presented at an international conference of chemists in Karlsruhe, it gained acceptance and led to a general agreement over molecular structures.	
black-bodies	1860	Blackbody Radiation	The theory of black bodies, suggested by Kirchhoff, posits that a body absorbing all light and reflecting none, known as a black body, when heated, emits all wavelengths of light. This led to significant advancements in understanding light and temperature distribution across the spectrum.	Gustav Robert Kirchhoff	Germany	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Physics	The theory of black bodies, suggested by Kirchhoff, posits that a body absorbing all light and reflecting none, known as a black body, when heated, emits all wavelengths of light. This theory was a crucial advancement in physics, aiding the understanding of light wavelength emission and temperature distribution across the total spectrum, eventually leading to a major revolution in physics.	
archeopteryx	1861	Archeopteryx	Archeopteryx is a fossil representing an ancient life form that lies between dinosaurs and birds, showing evolutionary transition. It showcases a blend of lizard-like and avian features, highlighting the link between the two groups.	Hermann von Meyer	Germany	iguanodon, evolution-by-natural-selection	Science:Biology	Although the giant dinosaurs, whose fossil relics had been dug up over the past forty years, were the most dramatic remnants of ancient life, the most important single fossil was not a giant, but a relatively small lizardlike animal that was discovered in 1861. It left a clear impression in a rock, which showed that it had a head possessing teeth and a beak, a long neck, a long tail, and a flat breastbone—all very lizardlike. There was, however, one all-important added feature. The 'lizard' had feathers. The imprints of those feathers are unmistakable. They are in a double row down the length of the tail and are also present along the forelimbs.	
brocas-area	1861	Broca's area	Gall had speculated that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body. Now a postmortem of Broca's patient who lost the ability to speak revealed damage to an area in the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum.	Pierre-Paul Broca	France	phrenology	Science:Biology	Gall had been of the opinion that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body. Gall’s conclusions were strictly speculative. Broca, the first person to present conclusive evidence of a specific region of the brain in charge of a specific function, had a fifty-one-year-old patient who had lost the ability to speak. When the patient died in 1861, a postmortem revealed damage to the third convolution on the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum (now known as Broca’s convolution). Gall’s insight, which had been misdirected into phrenology, was thus put right.	
thallium	1861	Thallium	Thallium was discovered through spectroscopy, distinguishing itself with a bright green spectral line. This element, derived from heated selenium ores, was significant for its unique identifying characteristic via spectroscopy.	William Crookes	England	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Chemistry	Kirchhoff was not the only one to discover new elements by means of spectroscopy. The British physicist William Crookes was working with selenium ores, and in 1861 he came upon a sample of such ore that when heated showed a bright green line characteristic of no known element. He analyzed the ore in search of the new element, found it, and named it thallium, from the Greek word for 'green twig' after the color of its line.	
germ-theory-of-disease	1862	Germ theory of disease	Pasteur surveyed the evidence and synthesized it into a theory that contagious diseases are caused by microorganisms. It revolutionized medicine, leading to the prevention and treatment of diseases and significantly increasing life expectancy.	Louis Pasteur	France	pasteurization, cholera	Science:Biology	In 1862, Pasteur took up the matter and issued a publication that gathered all the evidence supporting that microorganisms cause diseases. This became a pivotal advancement in medicine, reducing the death rate, doubling life expectancy, and contributing to a significant population growth. The theory allowed scientists to identify specific microorganisms responsible for diseases and develop ways to prevent or cure them.	
dim-companion-of-sirius	1862	Dim companion of sirius	Using a newly ground 18-inch lens, Clark saw an anomaly near Sirius. The existence of a dark companion star orbiting Sirius was confirmed through its gravitational influence. This discovery added to the understanding of binary star systems.	Alvan Graham Clark	United States	companion-of-sirius	Space	Bessel had suggested the existence of a dark companion of Sirius, one that could not be seen but whose existence was indicated by its gravitational influence. On January 31, 1862, American astronomer Alvan Graham Clark confirmed this by observing the companion star through a telescope.	
hydrogen-in-the-sun	1862	Hydrogen in the sun	In later years, astronomers began to use spectral lines to compare the position of the dark lines to determine the solar spectrum. Ångström discovered hydrogen in the Sun, and later published a spectrum with wavelengths represented by each line in units of ten-billionths of a meter, now known as the ångström.	Anders Jonas Ångström	Sweden	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Physics	In 1862, the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Ångström announced his discovery of hydrogen in the Sun. He went on, in later years, to publish a map of the spectrum that showed the position of the dark lines in comparison to the solar spectrum, measured in units that are still known today as the ångström.	
chloroplasts	1862	Chloroplasts	Rather than being uniformly spread through plant cells, chlorophyll is concentrated in discrete bodies named chloroplasts. Starch grains appeared within chloroplasts, supporting the product of photosynthesis.	Julius von Sachs	Germany	chlorophyll-and-cells	Science:Biology	In 1862, the German botanist Julius von Sachs observed that plant cells contained discrete chlorophyll bodies, which he called chloroplasts. He noted that starch grains appeared within these chloroplasts, linking them directly to photosynthesis.	
source-of-the-white-nile	1862	Source of the white nile	Confirmed that the stream flowing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the White Nile. Speke traced the longest river flowing into Lake Victoria, the Luvironza, establishing it as the true source of the Nile, located in modern-day Burundi.	Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke	England	nile-river	Geography	In 1862, explorations led by Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke confirmed that a stream issuing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the White Nile. Speke traced the longest inflowing river, the Luvironza, establishing it as the true source of the Nile, located in modern-day Burundi.	
ironclad-warships	1862	Ironclad warships	The Confederate ironclad warship Merrimack (later renamed Virginia) attacked and sank wooden Union ships with ease due to its iron armor. The Union responded with its own ironclad, Monitor, and after a five-hour indecisive battle, it became clear that wooden warships were outdated, leading navies worldwide to adopt ironclads.	John Ericsson	United States	bessemer-steel, transatlantic-liner	War	The ironclad warship Merrimack (later renamed Virginia) attacked and sank wooden Union ships with ease due to its iron armor. The Union responded with its own ironclad, Monitor, and after a five-hour indecisive battle, it became clear that wooden warships were outdated, leading navies worldwide to adopt ironclads.	
machine-guns	1862	Machine guns	The Gatling gun, the first machine gun, was invented to shoot multiple bullets in rapid succession, building on repeating rifles called carbines which had come into use in 1860. It greatly increased the firepower available to armed forces, making it a significant development in military technology.	Richard Jordan Gatling	United States	revolvers	War	American inventor Richard Jordan Gatling created a rapid-fire gun that could shoot nearly six bullets per second using a rotating barrel mechanism. This invention, known as the Gatling gun, was used by Union forces during the Civil War and represented a major advancement in repeating firearms.	
hemoglobin	1862	Hemoglobin	The protein hemoglobin, crucial in carrying oxygen in the blood, was identified and named. This discovery was fundamental in understanding blood's role in oxygen transportation.	Felix Hoppe-Seyler	Germany	protein, oxygen	Science:Biology	German biochemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler crystallized the protein hemoglobin, which combines with oxygen in the lungs and transports it to tissues. He gave it the name hemoglobin (derived from the Greek word for blood, hemo, and globin, a protein class), and discovered that hemoglobin becomes oxyhemoglobin when it binds with oxygen.	
greenhouse-effect	1863	Greenhouse effect	The concept describes how gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in surface temperatures. This phenomenon is similar to how a greenhouse works.	John Tyndall	England	infrared-radiation	Science:Physics	In 1863, the Irish physicist John Tyndall pointed out that gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor are transparent to the visible light that reaches Earth's surface from the Sun, but rather opaque to the infrared radiations that the Earth gives off to space when it cools down at night. This means that the presence of even a small amount of these gases in the air will keep the Earth's surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be. This resembles the situation in a greenhouse, where light enters through the glass and warms the atmosphere within, but heat escapes only with difficulty, so that the net effect is to warm the greenhouse. For this reason, the action of carbon dioxide and water vapor is referred to as the greenhouse effect. Since human activity has somewhat increased the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and is continuing to do so, the greenhouse effect has become a serious threat.	
law-of-octaves	1863	Law of octaves	Now that over sixty elements were known, the proposed Law of Octaves grouped elements based on their atomic weights in a repeating pattern, resembling musical octaves. This failed attempt helped pave the way for better-organized periodic tables.	John Alexander Reina Newlands	England		Science:Chemistry	By this time, over sixty elements were known, and they seemed to represent an unruly jungle of characteristics. Chemists were uneasy with that, so they tried to group elements into families. Several attempts had already been made, but an English chemist tried something a bit different. He listed the elements in order of atomic weight and found that the second seven repeated the properties of the first seven quite closely. He tried to extend this further, referring to it as the law of octaves (as in music, where the same seven notes are repeated over and over, with every eighth note resembling the first octave higher, octave coming from the Latin word for “eight”). Newlands's work was not taken seriously because the list of elements fit the law of octaves very imperfectly. Nevertheless, it helped put the listing of elements in vogue, and in the course of the following decade, a much superior table was established.	
constitution-of-the-stars	1863	Constitution of the stars	Spectral analysis of stars revealed that their composition was similar to elements found on Earth, suggesting a commonality in the universe's materials. This discovery supported the idea that the universe comprises the same elements throughout.	William Huggins	England	spectral-lines-and-elements	Space	Granted that the elements in the Sun seemed to be the same as those on Earth, might it be argued that the Solar System would naturally be made of one set of materials but that other stars might be made of other elements? The English astronomer William Huggins studied the spectra of some of the brighter stars and announced in 1863 that their spectral lines were those of the old familiar elements. Presumably, then, the entire Universe was made up of the same elements.	
barbiturates	1863	Barbiturates	The discovery of barbituric acid led to the development of barbiturates, a class of compounds significant in the formulation of sleeping pills. This medicinal discovery has had a lasting impact on pharmacology.	Adolf von Baeyer	Germany	acid-base	Science:Pharmacology	In 1863 the German chemist Adolf von Baeyer discovered barbituric acid. Barbituric acid is the parent substance of a family of compounds known as barbiturates, which are well known today for their use in sleeping pills.	
indium	1863	Indium	Indium was discovered through spectroscopic analysis of a zinc ore precipitate, revealing a new element with unique indigo spectral lines. 	Ferdinand Reich and Theodor Richter	Germany	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Chemistry	A German mineralogist suspected that a yellow precipitate he had obtained from a zinc ore might contain a new metal. Because he himself was color-blind, he had his assistant examine it spectroscopically. Richer did so and spotted an indigo-colored line that was not characteristic of any known element. The new element was therefore named indium.	
nature-of-orion-nebula	1864	Nature of Orion Nebula	The Orion Nebula, previously thought to be a simple cloud of gas, was discovered to contain clusters of faint stars. This finding indicated that stars are embedded in nebulous regions and contribute to the nebula's luminosity.	William Huggins	England	clusters-and-nebulas	Space	Some patches of nebulosity, including the Milky Way itself, had turned out to be clusters of faint stars. A number of Messier objects had turned out to be globular clusters. The Orion nebula was studied, and it was found that its spectrum was typical of what would be expected of a luminous gas. It was concluded that the nebula is a large cloud of gas with stars embedded in it, which heat the gas to luminosity.	
genetics	1865	Genetics	Mendel discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance by conducting experiments with pea plants. He observed how plant height was passed from one generation to the next. Dominant traits would overpower recessive ones, but the recessive traits could reappear in future generations.	Gregor Johann Mendel	Austria	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science: Biology	Gregor Mendel, an Austrian botanist and monk, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance by conducting experiments with pea plants. He observed how certain traits, like plant height, were passed from one generation to the next. By carefully arranging plants to self-pollinate and analyzing the traits in their offspring, Mendel concluded that organisms have pairs of factors for each trait that segregate during reproduction. Dominant traits would overpower recessive ones, but the recessive traits could reappear in future generations. His work laid the groundwork for the science of genetics.	
benzene-ring	1865	Benzene ring	The benzene ring is a molecular structure consisting of six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring with hydrogen atoms attached. This configuration made benzene stable and significantly contributed to the understanding of molecular structures.	August Kekulé	Germany	organic-molecular-structure	Science:Chemistry	The molecule of benzene is made up of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. Given a chain of six carbon atoms, there seemed to be no way of adding six hydrogen atoms without producing a very unstable compound—and benzene was quite stable. It was Kekulé himself who found the answer in 1865. According to his own story, he was in a semidoze in a horse-drawn bus and was visualizing carbon chains when suddenly the tail end of one chain attached itself to the head end and formed a spinning ring. At once he saw that if he imagined the six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon, a stable atom might be the result. Once the notion of carbon rings was added to that of carbon chains, many structural problems were solved.	
avogadros-number	1865	Avogadro’s number	Avogadro’s number represents the number of molecules in 22.4 liters of any gas, which is approximately 6×10^23. This measurement allowed scientists to quantify the number of atoms and molecules in a given volume and weigh gases accurately.	Johann Joseph Loschmidt	England	kinetic-theory-of-gases, avogadro-revived	Science:Chemistry	The hydrogen molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atom has an atomic weight of just about 1, so that a hydrogen molecule has a molecular weight of 2. Hydrogen gas is made up of hydrogen molecules, and at 0°C and normal atmospheric pressure at sea level, 22.4 liters (5.9 gallons) of hydrogen gas weigh 2 grams. This is the molecular weight in grams, or 1 mole. Since equal volumes of gases are made up of equal numbers of molecules, according to Avogadro’s hypothesis (see 1811), and since each oxygen molecule has a weight of 32, then 22.4 liters of oxygen gas would weigh 32 grams—or 1 mole. In fact, 22.4 liters of any gas are likely to weigh 1 mole. The question is, how many molecules are there in 22.4 liters of a gas? In 1865 the Austrian chemist Johann Joseph Loschmidt used Maxwell’s kinetic theory of gases (see 1859) to calculate what that number ought to be. It turned out to be about 600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or six hundred billion trillion. Since all this was based on Avogadro’s hypothesis, the number was called Avogadro’s number. From Avogadro’s number, you could calculate the actual mass of a hydrogen molecule, since it would be 2 grams divided by six hundred billion trillion. A hydrogen atom would have a mass half that, and the mass of other atoms and molecules could be calculated as well. For the first time, scientists had a notion, and a rather good one, as it turned out, of the mass of the tiny atoms and molecules that make up matter.	
antiseptic-surgery	1865	Antiseptic surgery	Lister introduced the use of phenol solutions to clean hands and instruments during surgeries, which significantly reduced post-operative infections. This advancement drastically reduced the mortality rates and complications associated with surgeries.	Joseph Lister	England	anesthesia, germ-theory-of-disease, puerperal-fever	Science:Medicine	Anesthetics had come into use nearly twenty years before, but if the process had become more...	
maxwells-equations	1865	Maxwell’s equations	Maxwell devised a set of equations that unified electricity and magnetism into a single electromagnetic force. These equations demonstrated the relationship between electric oscillations and electromagnetic fields, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	laws-motion	Science:Physics	The culminating work of Maxwell came when he began to devise a set of equations, simple in form, that expressed all the varied phenomena of electricity and magnetism and bound them together indissolubly, as Newton had done for gravitation. Maxwell showed that electricity and magnetism did not exist separately, but that each was an inevitable aspect of the other. There was a single electromagnetic force. Maxwell showed that the oscillation of an electric charge produced an electromagnetic field that radiated outward from its source at a constant speed. This speed could be calculated from the equations and turned out to be just the speed of light.	
mobius-strip	1865	Möbius strip	The Möbius strip is a one-sided surface that challenges traditional geometry, created by twisting a strip of paper 180 degrees and joining its ends. This concept found applications in various scientific and artistic fields, demonstrating properties of non-orientable surfaces and founding topology.	August Ferdinand Möbius	Germany	analytic-geometry	Math:Topology	In 1865, the German mathematician August Ferdinand Möbius presented what came to be called a Möbius strip. This is a long, flat strip of paper (or other flexible material) that is given a half twist and the two ends then pasted together to give a circular figure with one edge and one side. The resulting construction has only one surface and one edge. This made Möbius one of the founders of topology, the branch of mathematics that deals with properties of figures that are not altered by deformations (as long as there is no tearing).	
cylinder-locks	1865	Cylinder locks	Cylinder locks feature a key with a serrated edge that aligns spring-loaded pins within the lock cylinder to allow entry. This innovation significantly increased security for locks by making them difficult to pick and easy to mass-produce with unique key combinations.	Linus Yale	United States		Design	In 1865, an American locksmith patented a cylinder lock with tumblers that had to be brought into a certain alignment for the lock to open. The key had a serrated edge that sufficed to bring the tumblers into line. A vast number of combinations were possible, so that every key could be unique, even if there were millions of locks. The familiar locks and keys that have controlled house and apartment doors ever since are based on this principle.	
dynamite	1866	Dynamite	Dynamite is a powerful explosive material composed by safely combining nitroglycerine with kieselguhr. It allowed safe, controlled explosions for construction and mining, revolutionizing those industries.	Alfred Bernard Nobel	Sweden	nitroglycerine	Science: Chemistry	During the twenty years since nitroglycerine had been discovered, it had been used in blasting roads through mountains, digging canals, and laying foundations. However, it was highly unstable, and frequently caused accidental explosions. Swedish inventor Alfred Bernard Nobel developed a safer way of using nitroglycerine by combining it with kieselguhr, a substance that absorbed the liquid nitroglycerine without detonating. This combination, called dynamite, could be handled safely until an external detonator was used, making it ideal for controlled explosions in construction and mining. This invention significantly improved safety in these industries and led to the establishment of the annual Nobel prizes funded by Nobel's estate.	
clinical-thermometer	1866	Clinical thermometer	The clinical thermometer is a medical instrument designed to accurately measure a patient's body temperature. It made temperature measurement more convenient and reliable in clinical settings.	Thomas Clifford Allbutt	England	mercury-thermometer	Science: Medicine	Doctors had long recognized the importance of knowing a patient’s temperature, but existing thermometers were cumbersome, imprecise, and slow, often requiring up to 20 minutes to register results. British physician Thomas Clifford Allbutt developed a small thermometer that could be easily used to measure body temperature more quickly and accurately. This invention greatly improved clinical diagnostics and patient care, allowing for more efficient and precise monitoring of patient health.	
kirkwood-gaps	1866	Kirkwood gaps	The discovery of the Kirkwood gaps revealed that the distribution of asteroids in the asteroid belt is not uniform. These gaps occur due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter, which causes asteroids to be either pulled away or pushed into these gaps.	Daniel Kirkwood	United States	asteroids	Space	By now, nearly ninety asteroids had been discovered and their orbits calculated. It was clear that they were not evenly distributed, and the American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood showed in 1866 that there were definite gaps, since called 'Kirkwood gaps.' He explained these gaps by postulating that any asteroids that would have been in those gaps would revolve around the Sun in a period that had a simple ratio to the period of Jupiter. That meant that every two or three turns of the asteroid would bring it into the same position with respect to Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational pull would then be cumulative, and the asteroid would be forced either farther from the Sun or nearer to it, leaving a gap.	
earths-iron-core	1866	Earth's iron core	The hypothesis that Earth's center must be composed of denser material than its crust was confirmed through the study of meteorites. This led to the acceptance that Earth has a nickel-iron core, shaping our understanding of the planet's composition.	Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée	France	mass-of-the-earth, meteorites	Science:Geology	Ever since Cavendish had determined the Earth's mass (see 1798), it had been known that the Earth's average density was about twice that of its rocky crust. The conclusion was that Earth's center must be made of material that was denser than rock. Metal seemed to be the only reasonable alternative. The French geologist Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée, considering the fact that a number of meteorites were composed of a nickel-iron alloy (though most were rocky), assumed that if meteorites were remnants of an exploded planet, the rocky ones came from the outermost portions of the planet, and the nickel-iron ones came from its core. He reasoned that this would be true of Earth as well, so that Earth had a nickel-iron core. This has been accepted by geologists ever since.	
composition-of-a-nova	1866	Composition of a nova	The study of nova spectra revealed that they are dominated by hydrogen, indicating its presence as a major component of the Universe. This finding was pivotal in understanding the composition and behavior of novas.	William Huggins	England	supernova, reflecting-telescope	Space	Since the exceedingly bright novas spied by Tycho Brahe and by Kepler nearly three centuries before, further novas of the sort had been seen. Nevertheless, dim novas had been sighted, and they still attracted notice because they had brightened suddenly and without warning. In 1866 Huggins managed to study the spectrum of a nova and showed from its spectral lines that it was surrounded by a cloud of hydrogen. This was the first indication that hydrogen might be a dominating constituent of the Universe.	
dry-cell	1867	Dry cell	Up to now, all batteries were made of liquids inside a container, which was not safe. The dry cell battery was invented, which converted battery fluid into a non-spillable paste. This innovation made batteries safer and more practical for everyday use.	Georges Leclanché	France	storage-battery	Science:Chemistry	Batteries before this consisted of liquid-filled containers that required careful handling. In 1867, Georges Leclanché created a cell that converted the liquid into a stiff paste, making it much safer and easier to use. The resulting dry cells enabled the widespread use of batteries in various small devices, from flashlights to toys.	
typewriters	1867	Typewriters	The first typewriter that could be used to write as quickly as hand writing was invented, streamlining the process of document creation. This invention marked a significant advancement in writing technology.	Christopher Latham Sholes	United States	printing-press	Design:Technology	Printing had existed for centuries but writing letters or stories still had to be done by hand. Attempts to create machines for this purpose existed, but they were cumbersome and slow. In 1867, Christopher Latham Sholes invented the first reasonably compact and practical writing machine, which could produce documents more quickly than manual handwriting.	
law-of-mass-action	1867	Law of mass action	The law of mass action describes how chemical reactions can be reversed by varying the mass of the reactants. This principle has been fundamental in advancing the field of thermodynamics and chemical reaction engineering.	Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage	Norway	thermochemistry	Science:Chemistry	Chemists discovered that chemical reactions could often proceed in two directions, and by increasing the mass of one set of reactants, the reaction could be forced to move in the direction that consumed that set. Norwegian chemists Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage demonstrated that it's not mass alone but concentration—the quantity of mass in a given volume—that determines reaction direction. Known as the law of mass action, it was promulgated in 1867 and laid the foundation for modern thermodynamics and its application to chemical reactions.	
air-brake	1868	Air brake	The air brake uses compressed air to simultaneously stop every wheel on a train, greatly improving rail safety. This invention overcame the difficulty of manually stopping trains, which involved significant risks of collisions and accidents.	George Westinghouse	United States	steam-locomotive-improved	Design: Engineering	In 1868 the American engineer George Westinghouse invented the air brake, which used compressed air rather than human muscle. Such an air brake could be applied simultaneously to every wheel on the train. Cornelius Vanderbilt dismissed the idea as a 'fool notion' because he did not believe that one could stop a train by the use of air. However, the air brake, after some improvements, caught on quickly and greatly increased rail safety.	
helium	1868	Helium	Thanks to modern transportation, astronomers could take a journey to see an eclipse if they liked. Studying an eclipse in India, Janssen discovered a new spectral line corresponding to a new element, Helium.	Pierre-Jules-César Janssen	France	spectral-lines-and-elements, transatlantic-liner	Space	Improvements in transportation had made it possible for astronomers to travel all over the world if they had to. The most spectacular astronomical phenomenon that might be confined to a small area almost anywhere in the world was a total eclipse of the Sun. When an eclipse was due to be visible at certain areas in India in 1868, European astronomers didn’t hesitate to make the journey. A French astronomer at the site, Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, studied the spectra of the solar prominences. Meanwhile, a British astronomer, Joseph Norman Lockyer, showed that by allowing light from the edge of the Sun to pass through a prism, he could obtain spectra of prominences even without an eclipse. Janssen observed a spectral line that did not match any of the known lines in position. He sent a report on this to Lockyer, who decided that the line represented a hitherto unknown element. The element was named helium, from the Greek word for 'sun.'	
cro-magnon-man	1868	Cro-magnon man	The discovery of Cro-Magnon man in a cave revealed that these humans were around thirty-five thousand years old, indicating an early form of modern humans. This finding challenged the belief that the human race was far younger and shed light on human evolution.	Édouard-Armand-Isidore-Hippolyte Lartet	France	neanderthal-man	Science:Archaeology	In 1868, a French paleontologist discovered four skeletons of human beings in a cave called Cro-Magnon. They were around thirty-five thousand years old but human in every respect, demonstrating that this earlier form of human was significantly older than previously thought.	
deep-sea-life	1868	Deep-sea life	The discovery of deep-sea life revealed that living organisms could thrive in depths far lower than light could reach. This groundbreaking finding expanded our understanding of marine biology and the adaptability of life forms.	Charles Wyville Thomson	England	telegraph-plateau	Science:Biology	In 1868, a British zoologist began deep-sea dredging operations, leading to the identification of life forms thriving in the depths of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans. This research showed that life exists from the ocean's surface to its depths, even though deep-sea life does not live in the same profusion as surface life.	
periodic-table-of-the-elements	1869	Periodic table of the elements	Arranging elements in order of increasing atomic weight, Mendeleev allowed the length of periods to vary according to the properties of elements, creating a table that predicted undiscovered elements. His periodic table became the foundation for modern chemistry, providing a systematic way to understand element properties and interactions.	Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev	Russia	law-of-octaves	Science:Chemistry	In Mendeleev's original periodic table of 1871, the periods were listed vertically and groups horizontally, with elements arranged by increasing atomic weight. He predicted the existence and properties of then-undiscovered elements by leaving gaps, some of which were later filled by actual discoveries such as eka-silicon (germanium). This new organization allowed for periodic trends and valences to be more apparent, leading to a comprehensive understanding of chemical properties and behaviors.	
nucleic-acid	1869	Nucleic acid	A substance was isolated from cell remnants that did not belong to the known classes of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. This substance was later identified as nucleic acid and contained nitrogen and phosphorus.	Johann Friedrich Miescher	Switzerland	food-classification	Science:Biology	The classification of foodstuffs into carbohydrates, fats, and proteins was satisfactory until 1869. In that year, a Swiss biochemist isolated a substance in cell nuclei, named 'nuclein', that contained nitrogen and phosphorus and did not belong to any known classes of foodstuffs. The true importance of nuclein, later known as nucleic acid, was appreciated when it was revealed as essential to the cell's functions.	
critical-temperature	1869	Critical temperature	An Irish physical chemist determined the specific temperature above which gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. This concept became essential for chemists working with permanent gases.	Thomas Andrews	Ireland	permanent-gases	Science:Physics	An Irish physical chemist studied the liquefaction of gases, particularly carbon dioxide. He discovered that as the temperature rose, more pressure was needed to liquefy it until it reached a critical temperature at which only lower temperatures could enable liquefaction. This critical temperature was crucial for chemists dealing with so-called permanent gases.	
biogeography	1869	Biogeography	A naturalist developed the concept separating animal species of Australia and Asia, marking a distinct ecological divide that laid the foundations of biogeography. "Wallace's line" drew a clear separation between the evolutionary paths of species on the two continents.	Alfred Russel Wallace	England	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science:Geography	A naturalist noticed significant differences between the animal species of Australia and Asia, leading him to delineate a boundary, known as Wallace's line, which separates these two distinct groups. This realization laid the groundwork for the science of biogeography, which explores the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time.	
islets-of-langerhans	1869	Islets of langerhans	A German physician identified clusters of cells within the pancreas that produce hormones essential for regulating blood sugar levels. These clusters were named the Islets of Langerhans after their discoverer.	Paul Langerhans	Germany	diabetes	Science:Biology	A German physician, while studying the microscopic structure of the pancreas, identified numerous small, distinct clusters of cells. These cell clusters, later named Islets of Langerhans, were found to play a crucial role in producing hormones that regulate blood sugar levels, significantly advancing the understanding of endocrine pancreas function.	
celluloid	1869	Celluloid	Celluloid is the first commercially successful plastic, made from pyroxylin and used for various materials like baby rattles, shirt collars, and photographic film. Its light, flexible, and waterproof properties greatly impacted the manufacturing of household items despite its flammability.	John Wesley Hyatt	United States	pyroxylin	Science: Chemistry	Celluloid is a type of plastic material originally made from pyroxylin. It was invented to find a cheaper alternative to ivory for billiard balls. Although it did not win the prize for this purpose, it found practical applications in various products due to its light, flexible, waterproof, and easy-to-clean properties. However, its flammable nature was a significant drawback. Regardless, it marked the advent of commercially viable plastics.	
stock-ticker	1869	Stock ticker	The stock ticker, a telegraph machine for transmitting gold prices, revolutionized financial communication by providing real-time stock market information. It played a significant role in the efficiency and effectiveness of financial trading.	Thomas Alva Edison	United States	telegraph	Design	The stock ticker was invented by Thomas Alva Edison after observing the inefficient methods in a broker's office. This telegraph machine transmitted gold prices and other stock information, allowing investors to receive timely updates. The invention of the stock ticker dramatically improved the speed and reliability of financial transactions, making a lasting impact on Wall Street and the financial industry.	
troy	1870	Troy	Discovery of multiple ancient sites of immense historical interest in present-day Turkey. Heinrich Schliemann used Homer's Iliad to locate the remains and various artifacts, notably contributing to archaeological research.	Heinrich Schliemann	Germany	literature	Science:Archaeology	The ancient non-Biblical site of most interest to Europeans was surely Troy, in what is now the northwestern part of Asian Turkey. It was there that the semilegendary Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C., and many who had read Homer's Iliad in the last twenty-five centuries had thought there was a historical basis to it. One of the believers was a German businessman, Heinrich Schliemann, who worked hard to make a fortune, for the sole purpose of using it to locate the ruined city of Troy. In 1870 he went to Turkey, managed to choose the right spot (following the description in the Iliad), and uncovered a series of ancient cities, built one on top of the other. He obtained various fascinating artifacts, many of them made of gold. Although Schliemann was not the first archaeologist, and was a very unscientific one, ruining a great deal more than he found, his findings were sensational and rang through the world. His work was a great stimulant to archaeological research in general.	
human-evolution	1871	Human evolution	Darwin published "Descent of Man" discussing the principles of evolution as it specifically applies to humans. The publication emphasizes the role of biological evolution in shaping human life and identifies vestigial organs as evidence for evolution.	Charles Darwin	England	evolution-by-natural-selection, cro-magnon-man	Science:Biology	Darwin, writing his book on evolution, had initially refrained from discussing human evolution to avoid controversy. In 1871, he published *The Descent of Man,* which applied the principles of evolution to humanity, highlighting the significance of biological evolution in human development. He pointed out vestigial organs in humans as evidence for evolution from nonhuman animals.	
dry-plates	1871	Dry plates	A development in photography that allowed the use of dry solutions instead of collodion, making it easier and faster to produce photographs. This innovation increased the sensitivity and ease of use in photographic processes.	Joseph Wilson Swan	England	photography	Design:Photography	Until this invention, photography relied on solutions smeared on plates or films, which were difficult to handle. Swan found that heating these solutions increased their sensitivity and drying them made the results more consistent. The use of dry plates revolutionized photography by reducing exposure times and simplifying the photographic process.	
plant-strains	1871	Plant strains	The cultivation and development of new plant strains that demonstrated the variation within species and supported the theory of evolution through natural selection. This work highlighted the potential for creating new varieties of plants through careful selection and breeding.	Luther Burbank	United States	evolution-by-natural-selection, genetics	Science:Botany	Luther Burbank began his extensive work on cultivating new plant strains. He specialized in producing new fruit strains and developed sixty varieties of plums among other plants. His work provided clear examples of the capacity for variation within organisms and supported Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.	
gilgamesh	1872	Gilgamesh found	The epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest literary work, was uncovered and it contained a flood story similar to the Biblical tales. This discovery further increased popular interest in archaeology.	George Smith	England	literature, cuneiform-decipherment	Culture	The last great king of the Assyrian Empire, Ashurbanipal, had patronized art and literature and established a large library in Nineveh. In the 1860s, British archaeologists excavated the site of ruined Nineveh and brought cuneiform tablets back to the British Museum. George Smith, an expert at reading cuneiform, discovered the epic of Gilgamesh in 1872 and announced it contained a flood story used by Biblical writers. This created a large sensation and increased popular interest in archaeology.	
bacteriology	1872	Bacteriology	Bacteriology, the study of bacteria, became prominent when it was discovered that numerous bacteria were pathogenic. They are also extremely resilient, capable of surviving desiccation and boiling. This field of study advanced the understanding of diseases and their contagious nature.	Ferdinand Julius Cohn	Germany	germ-theory-of-disease	Science:Biology	Bacteria, known for two centuries, were not studied in detail until Pasteur's germ theory of disease in 1862. A German botanist, inspired by Pasteur's work, was the first to treat bacteriology as a special branch of knowledge in 1872. It was discovered that some bacteria were pathogenic, causing certain diseases and their contagious character.	
stellar-photography	1872	Stellar photography	This involves photographing a star’s spectrum to study light sources. It eventually allowed astronomers to photograph the spectra of over a hundred stars.	Henry Draper	United States	dry-plates	Space	The American astronomer Henry Draper was the first to photograph a star’s spectrum (that of Vega). As Draper adopted the use of dry plates, stellar photography became easier, facilitating the capture of the spectra of numerous stars.	
experimental-psychology	1872	Experimental psychology	Experimental psychology was initiated to measure facets of human behavior using scientific methods. It includes the establishment of laboratories and journals for publishing behavioral findings.	Wilhelm Wundt	Germany		Science:Psychology	Wilhelm Wundt suggested that aspects of human behavior could be measured profitably. He wrote a textbook on the subject and later established the first laboratory and journal dedicated to experimental psychology.	
gas-laws	1873	Gas laws	van der Waals showed that gases follow certain laws relating volume, pressure, and temperature only if the molecules have a small volume and a small attraction between them. His demonstration refined the earlier understanding established by Boyle and others.	Johannes Diderik van der Waals	Netherlands	boyles-law	Science:Chemistry	Johannes Diderik van der Waals showed that gases follow certain laws relating volume, pressure, and temperature only if the molecules have a small volume and a small attraction between them. His demonstration refined the earlier understanding established by Boyle and others.	
leprosy	1873	Leprosy	A bacterium was discovered as the cause of leprosy, which led to the disease being named Hansen's disease. This marked the first discovery of a microorganism causing a specific disease, providing a breakthrough in medical microbiology.	Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen	Norway	bacteriology	Science:Biology	In 1873, a Norwegian physician discovered that a specific bacterium was the cause of leprosy, and as a result, it became known as Hansen's disease. This pivotal discovery marked the first occasion where a specific microorganism was identified as causing a particular disease, significantly advancing the field of medical microbiology and the understanding of infectious diseases.	
transcendental-e	1873	Transcendental e	Hermite proved that e (a very important mathematical constant ~ 2.71828) is a transcendental number. Transcendental numbers cannot be solutions to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients.	Charles Hermite	France	transcendental-numbers	Math	In 1873, a French mathematician succeeded in proving that e (a very important mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828) is a transcendental number. This significant discovery involved proving that certain numbers, called transcendental numbers, cannot be solutions to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients, thus expanding the knowledge of irrational numbers in mathematics.	
platelets	1873	Platelets	Platelets, also called thrombocytes, were identified and studied, revealing their role in blood clotting. This discovery marked a crucial advancement in hematology and understanding of blood components.	William Osler	Canada	red-blood-cells	Science:Medicine	In 1873, a Canadian physician studied platelets (small cells in the blood) which are fewer in number than red and white blood cells, but play a crucial role in blood clotting. These cells, called thrombocytes, were extensively studied for their shape and function, leading to important discoveries about their role in the clotting process and significance in medical hematology.	
gallium	1874	Gallium	A new element named gallium was discovered, displaying unique spectral lines and validating predictions made in the periodic table. This discovery firmly established Mendeleyev’s table, confirming it for subsequent scientific exploration.	Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran	France	periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science:Chemistry	The discovery of new elements continued after Mendeleyev announced his periodic table of elements. In 1874, the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran found a zinc ore that displayed previously unknown spectral lines. He extracted the new element and named it gallium, from the old Latin word for the area that later became France after the fall of the Roman Empire. Mendeleyev had predicted this element as eka-aluminium, and gallium's characteristics and properties aligned with his prediction, solidifying the validity of the periodic table.	
tetrahedral-carbon-atom	1874	Tetrahedral carbon atom	A new three-dimensional representation of organic molecules demonstrated that molecules must be asymmetric to rotate polarized light, showing that the four valence bonds of the carbon atom pointed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron. 	Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff	Netherlands	organic-molecular-structure, geometry	Science:Chemistry	Kekule's earlier two-dimensional models of organic molecules had limitations, as some molecules in solution rotated the plane of polarized light, implying necessary asymmetry. In 1874, Dutch physical chemist Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff advanced this understanding by creating a three-dimensional model. He showed that the four valence bonds of the carbon atom pointed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron, with one bond pointing upward and three arranged equally below, illustrating the essential structural asymmetry of organic molecules in achieving specific chemical behaviors.	
transfinite-numbers	1874	Transfinite numbers	The invention of transfinite numbers illustrates an endless series of numbers larger than the ordinary infinity of integers. This concept revolutionized mathematical understanding of infinity and real numbers.	Ludwig Philipp Cantor	Germany		Math	The German mathematician Ludwig Philipp Cantor introduced the concept of transfinite numbers, addressing the troublesome notion of infinity. He demonstrated that while all fractions (rational numbers) are countable through one-to-one correspondence, real numbers (rational and irrational) are not, representing a higher form of infinity. This mathematical innovation showed that real numbers exist in an endlessly larger quantity, changing our approach to infinity and counting.	
current-and-crystals	1874	Current and crystals	It was discovered that in some crystals, electric current can pass through in one direction but not the other. This finding later led to significant advancements in electronics and technology.	Karl Ferdinand Braun	Germany	electrical-conductance, crystallography	Science: Physics	German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun observed in 1874 that some crystals allowed electric current to pass through in one direction but not the other. At the time, the full implications and reasons were not clear, but this curious observation paved the way for later technological advancements, particularly in the development of diodes and semiconductor technology.	
fertilization-observed	1875	Fertilization	Fertilization was observed when a sperm cell entered an egg cell of a sea urchin, confirming that a union of both was necessary for the birth of young. This observation greatly advanced the understanding of reproductive biology.	Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig	Germany	fertilization	Science:Biology	Egg cells and sperm cells were both known, and it was clear that the birth of young required a union of the two. Nevertheless, such a union was not observed until the German embryologist Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig saw a sperm cell actually enter the egg cell of a sea urchin. What's more, although sperm cells are produced in swarming plenty, Hertwig could see that but a single sperm cell entered the egg cell and that it sufficed for fertilization.	
radiometer	1875	Radiometer	The radiometer was created to demonstrate the effects of solar radiation by using pivoted vanes (one side blackened, the other shiny) in a vacuum that turned when exposed to sunlight. It provided vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.	William Crookes	England	geissler-tubes, kinetic-theory-of-gases	Science:Physics	In 1875 Crookes devised the radiometer, consisting of a set of pivoted vanes in a vacuum. One side of each vane was blackened so that it would absorb heat, and the other side was shiny so that it would reflect it. In the presence of sunlight, the vanes turned steadily. This was not due to solar radiation, for if the container was evacuated particularly well, the motion ceased. Actually, the air molecules in the imperfect vacuum rebounded from the heated side more strongly than from the cooler, shiny side, thus 'kicking' it around. This required a partial vacuum to work, as otherwise air resistance would muffle the motion. The radiometer was only a toy, but it offered vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.
