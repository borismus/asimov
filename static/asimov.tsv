miners-friend	1698	Miner's friend	Miner's Friend invented to pump water out of flooded mines. Steam-powered air pump to help English coal mining, which was increasingly relied upon because of shortage of wood.	Thomas Savery	England	air-pump, coal-mining	Science			
scientific-voyages	1698	Scientific ocean voyages	First ocean voyage exclusively for science. Prior, voyages were taken for exploration, settlement or trade, with science as a side-effect. Halley's voyage measured magnetic declinations around the world, prepared first map of the world showing isodeclination, and accurate lat/long for ports.	Edmond Halley	England	india-water-route	Science			
gas-volume-temperature	1699	Gas volume temperature	Discovery that volume of gas proportional to temperature. A step towards gas laws, but not quite precise enough measurements yet.	Guillaume Amontons	France	air-pressure	Science			
binary-system	1700	Binary system	First use of non-decimal bases (2, 8, 12). A binary number is a number expressed in base 2, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1.	Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz	Germany	decimal-notation	Math			
comet-orbits	1705	Comets' Orbits	Comet orbits remained mysterious. Halley claimed that comet orbits were elliptical, just very elongated. At the time, he was not taken seriously, but when he successfully predicted the return of a comet 50 years later, he was vindicated posthumously.	Edmund Halley	England	comet-distance,laws-motion	Space			
plant-nourishment	1705	Plant Nourishment	Discovery that air contributed to the nourishment of plants, not just water. Also the first to collect gas by bubbling them through water and trapping in an inverted vessel.	Stephen Hales	England	gas	Science:Chemistry			
carriage-springs	1706	Carriage springs	Up to now, passengers of all wheeled vehicles were jolted by every road imperfection. Springs helped to absorb some of them, at the expense of swaying.			paved-road,steel	Culture			
static-electricity-improved	1706	Improved static generator	Greatly improved upon Guericke's static electricity generator by constructing a glass sphere turned by a crank that used friction to generate electricity. Led to more experiments with static electricity.	Francis Hauksbee	England	static-electricity	Science:Physics			
pulse-watch	1707	Pulse watch	By now clocks could tell time to the nearest minute, so minute hands were added to clocks in the late 17th century. Floyer invented a device which when wound would run for exactly 60 seconds. This allowed to calculate heart rate for the first time!	John Floyer	England	pendulum-clock, hand-watch	Science:Biology			
coke-iron	1709	Coke and iron	Iron smelting required high temperatures previously only attainable by burning coal. But coal was becoming increasingly expensive as English forests continued to recede. Coke turns out to be even more effective for smelting iron and could be done at higher temperatures and larger scale.	Abraham Darby	England	mineralogy, steel	Science			
rifle	1710	Rifle	If a gun barrel is outfitted with spiral grooves ("rifled"), the bullet will spin around its axis and aim better, but this requires better gun construction. The new Pennsylvania rifle took twice as long to reload but had triple the range.		America	musket	War			
newcomen-steam-engine	1712	Newcomen steam engine	The demand for coal was increasing, so were coal mining operations, and the need to pump water out of mines. Newcomen invented a new type of steam engine that could use lower pressure steam and was safer than Savery's Miner's Friend. Still very inefficient.	Thomas Newcomen	England	coke-iron,miners-friend, pressure-cooker	General			
smallpox-vaccine	1713	Smallpox inoculation	Smallpox was highly contagious and deadly, and left survivors disfigured with pockmarks. But the disease didn't recur in the same person. In Turkey, some began deliberately spreading mild cases of the disease through pus, but this was fraught.	Mary Wortley Montagu	England	epilepsy	Science:Biology			
mercury-thermometer	1714	Mercury thermometer	Ferdinand II de Medici was first to invent a closed thermometer (immune from effects of pressure), but used water or alcohol which didn't expand evenly with temperature. Fahrenheit made the switch to Mercury to remedy this. The scale is named after him, which starts at 0 because it was the coldest temperature he could create.	Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit	Germany	gas-volume-temperature,thermometer	Science:Physics			
solar-eclipse	1715	Solar eclipse	23 centuries prior, Thales predicted the eclipse which happened on April 22, 1715. Halley plotted the path of the eclipse and organized a number of observers to watch the eclipse.	Edmond Halley	England	eclipse, reflecting-telescope	Space			
stellar-motion	1718	Stellar motion	Up to now, it had been assumed that the stars were fixed in the sky. However, upon careful observation of bright stars Sirius, Procyon, and Arcturus, Halley found that they'd moved relative to the observations of Tycho.	Edmond Halley	England	supernova	Space			
easter-island	1722	Easter Island	Just 45 square miles in area, and 1200 miles from nearest land (a small island), likely the farthest point reached by the Polynesians. Roggeveen also discovered the Samoan Islands.	Jacob Roggeveen	Netherlands	around-earth	Geography			
longitude	1728	Ship’s chronometer	A ship's latitude (declination from equator) can be determined from the position of the sun or north star. But to measure longitude, you need to know time. Pendulums clocks don't work on swaying ships. Spurred by a large prize from the British government, Harrison built highly accurate sea clocks.	John Harrison	England	pendulum-clock,ocean-navigation	General			
aberration-light	1728	Aberration of light	Since heliocentricity, astronomers tried to see parallax in the stars as a result of the earth moving around the sun (186 million miles displacement). Rather than finding this parallax, Bradley ooked through a 212ft long telescope and found he had to tip the scope to catch the light as the earth moved, and unlocked a new way to calculate the speed of light.	James Bradley	England	comet-distance, speed-of-light	Science:Physics			
bering-strait	1728	Bering Strait	Peter I commissioned Bering, a Dutch navigator to explore far reaches of eastern Russia. He first mapped Kamchatka and then sailed north and reached the arctic ice without sighting land, continuing through the Bering Strait. This was definitive proof that North America was not part of Asia.	Vitus Jonassen Bering	Russia	new-world	Geography			
dentistry	1728	Dentistry	The first book entirely devoted to Dentistry was "Le chirurgien dentiste", discussing artificial dentures, crowns, how to treat cavities with metal fillings. Fauchard is considered the father of dentistry.	Pierre Fauchard	France	anatomy	Science:Biology			
electrical-conductance	1729	Electrical conductance	When he electrified a long glass tube, corks on both ends were electrified despite not having been touched. He tried this with other mediums, like 800ft long twine, and found that "electrical fluid" traveled through some mediums (conductors) better than others (insulators).	Stephen Gray	England	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics			
achromatic-lens	1733	Achromatic lens	Different kinds of glass produce spectra of different widths. Flint glass (contains lead) produced wider spectrum than crown (regular) glass. By combining a convex lens out of crown, and a concave lens out of flint glass, he made a lens that magnified without producing colors.	Chester Moor Hall	England	light-spectrum, concave-lenses	Science:Physics			
blood-pressure	1733	Blood pressure	Hales went from studying the flow of sap in plants to the flow of blood in animals, measuring rates of flow in different parts of the circulatory system. He wrote Hemostaticks in 1733.	Stephen Hales	England	plant-nourishment	Science:Biology			
positive-negative-charge	1733	Positive and negative charge	While studying static electricity, du Fay found that if you electrify two objects using different means (one by glass rod -- "vitreous", one by resin rod -- "resinous"), you can have them attract one another. He suggested two different kinds of electrical fluids.	Charles-Francois de Cisternay du Fay	France	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics			
flying-shuttle	1733	Flying shuttle	In weaving, a shuttle with yarn (weft) criss-crosses stationary yarn (warp), forming a lattice. Kay invented the flying shuttle, which enabled the weaver to pull the shuttle by means of two cords, greatly accelerating the process.	John Kay	England	laws-motion	Science:Physics			
shape-of-earth-confirmed	1735	Shape of the Earth	If the earth was the shape Newton suggested it was, a degree of latitude near the poles should be greater in mileage than at the equator. One explorer went to the equator (Peru), the other to the north pole (Lapland), confirming Newton. Sea level at equator is 13 miles farther from center than sea level at poles.	Charles Marie de la Condamine / Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis	France	shape-of-earth	Geography			
taxonomy	1735	Taxonomy	Linnaeus traveled over 4600 miles through northern Scandinavia, discovering hundreds of new plant species. He referred to each plant by genus and species (eg. Homo sapiens), the binomial nomenclature we still use today. And invented the taxonomy of classes, orders.	Carl von Linne	Sweden	plant-species-classified	Science:Biology			
trade-winds	1735	Trade winds	Hadley found that air near the equator had a faster west-to-east motion than air farther from it. This is due to the uneven heating of the earth due to the sun: hotter at the equator, cooler at poles, and the coriolis effect. Today this model is called the Hadley cell.	George Hadley	England	meteorological-map	Science:Physics			
mechanics	1736	Mechanics	Newton's principia featured geometric proofs of his claims. Euler wrote "Mechanics", and provided proofs using algebra and calculus.	Leonhard Euler	Switzerland	laws-motion	Science:Physics			
cobalt	1737	Cobalt	Miners were puzzled at some varieties of copper ore which didn't yield copper when smelted, and suspected foul play from kobolds, a type of mythical sprite. Upon closer examination, it was a new element (after Phosphorus), and Brandt named it cobalt. This was the first metal to be discovered not known to the medeival alchemists.	Georg Brandt	Sweden	phosphorus	Science:Chemistry			
kinetic-gases	1738	Kinetic theory of gases	Bernoulli modeled gas as many small particles in rapid movement, with temperature increasing their speed. As a result, increasing temperature increases volume (keeping pressure the same). Similarly, increasing temperature increases pressure if volume is kept fixed.	Daniel Bernoulli	Switzerland	boyles-law	Science:Physics			
rocky-mountains	1739	Rocky Mountains	The French continued their exploration of North America, with brother Pierre and Paul Mallet reaching Colorado and becoming the first Europeans to see the Rockies.	Pierre and Paul Mallet	France	america	Geography			
hydra	1740	Hydra	Trembley discovered the hydra, a small primitive organism resembling a plant, but actually an animal. It's tiny tentacles resembled the formidable Hydra destroyed by Hercules. And this hydra could regenerate parts that were cut off, as well as merge with other hydras to become one organism.	Abraham Trembley	Switzerland	plant-species-classified, animal-classification-improved	Science:Biology			
celsius	1742	Celsius scale	The Fahrenheit scale was commonly used, but phase changes were set at awkward quantities: melting at 32 F and boiling at 212 F. Celsius rationalized this by setting them to 0 and 100 respectively.	Anders Celsius	Sweden	mercury-thermometer	Science:Physics			
goldbach	1742	Goldbach’s conjecture	Working in Russia, German mathematician formulated a conjecture, still unproven: "Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."	Christian Goldbach	Russia	arab-numbers	Math			
franklin-stove	1742	Franklin stove	Fires in confined areas cause a lot of smoke, and chimneys allow hot air from the fire to escape immediately. Rather than creating a draft, Franklin devised a stove that would heat up the metal of the stove and let the air escape much more slowly. Initially it sold poorly, but David Rittenhouse made significant improvements.	Benjamin Franklin	America	fire,boyles-law	General			
transcendental-numbers	1744	Transcendental numbers	In mathematics, a transcendental number is a complex number that is not an algebraic number—that is, not a root (i.e., solution) of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. The best-known transcendental numbers are π and e.	Leonhard Euler	Switzerland	imaginary-numbers	Math			
leyden-jar	1745	Leyden jar	A Leyden jar stores a high-voltage electric charge (from an external source) between electrical conductors on the inside and outside of a glass jar. This was an improvement over Hauksbee's glass sphere, and gave its inventor a major shock. The same device was independently invented by a German physicist von Kleist. Named after the inventor's University of Leiden.	Peter van Musschenbroek	Netherlands	static-electricity-improved	Science:Physics			
blood-and-iron	1745	Blood and iron	The chemical composition of blood was completely unknown until an experimenter fed iron to dogs to see if the iron would be incorporated in the blood. As a control, he checked the composition of regular dog blood and found that it already contained iron, specifically in red blood cells.	Vincenzo Menghini	Italy	red-blood-cells	Science:Biology			
scurvy	1747	Scurvy	More men were disabled by scurvy on long sea voyages than by any other cause. Lind served in the navy and knew how monotonous the diet was, and also knew that scurvy also appeared in other such environments (prisons, under siege). He studied the effect of fruits on scurvy and found citrus provided great relief.	James Lind	England	india-water-route	Science:Biology			
osmosis	1748	Osmosis	Intuitively, if a liquid can soak through a solid, it should be able to seep through in any direction. Nollet found that you can have semipermeable membranes that allow one type of liquid but not another. Thus enables unidirectional fluid flow.	Jean Antoine Nollet	France	hydrostatics	Science:Physics			
platinum	1749	Platinum	Existence of platnium was generally unknown since it is as rare as gold, but lacks its ostentatious beauty. It was scientifically studied by Ulloa, who found it to be denser than gold, higher melting and less reactive.	Antonio de Ulloa	Spain	steel	Science:Chemistry			
biological-evolution	1749	Biological evolution	Buffon was the first to speculate openly about evolution in a book called "Natural History", where he imagined an evolution in reverse: apes as degenerate humans, donkeys as degenerate horses, jackals as degenerate wolves. He was wrong, but it implied that species could change over time.	Louis Leclerc de Buffon	France	taxonomy	Science:Biology			
formation-earth	1749	Formation of the Earth	Buffon thought that there may have been a natural (not God) cause to Earth's creation, such as the collision of the Sun with a comet. He also estimated Earth's age by calculating how long it would take an Earth-sized object to cool from the temperature of the sun. His estimates of 75,000 years were wrong, but this was much greater than 6000.	Louis Leclerc de Buffon	France	comet-distance,biblical-age-of-earth	Space			
nickel	1751	Nickel	Cronstedt studied under Brandt, who isolated cobalt, and isolated another metal from ore that was neither copper nor cobalt. Colloquially known as kupfernickel by miners, he dubbed it nickel for short. Turned out nickel was also magnetic but weaker than iron.	Axel Fredrick Cronstedt	Sweden	cobalt	Science:Chemistry			
encyclopedia	1751	Encyclopedia	Diderot compiled a multivolume summary of all knowledge for the general public, with alphabetical entries. This was fitting at a time that called itself the Age of Reason.	Denis Diderot	France	printing-press	General			
lightning-rod	1752	Lightning rod	Franklin coined the terms "positive" and "negative" charge, rejecting du Fay's notion of two kinds of electrical fluids. He imagined that during a lightning strike, the earth and sky form a gigantic Leyden jar and flew a kite in a thunderstorm and found that the silk thread showed signs of electrical charge. He was also able to charge a real Leyden jar using this energy, proving that the two electricities were identical. Franklin generalized this idea and built tall metal spires on top of buildings, which averted lightning-induced fires, the first mitigation of natural disaster through science.	Benjamin Franklin	America	leyden-jar,positive-negative-charge	Science:Physics			
digestion	1752	Digestion	Up to now, there was debate whether digestion was chemical or mechanical in nature. In an experiment on hawks and dogs, Reaumur showed that it had to be both. Thus in addition to behaving like a mechanical machine, the body also has a chemical aspect.	Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur	France	muscles-bones, metabolism	Science:Biology			
earth-heat	1752	Earth and heat	Most Europeans up to now attributed changes to the Earth's surface to forces of water (called Neptunists). However Guettard challenged this after observing that rocks experienced great changes in temperature in the past.	Etienne Guettard	France	water-element,formation-earth	Science:Geology			
carbon-dioxide	1754	Carbon dioxide	Up to now, carbon dioxide had only been detected as a product of combustion or fermentation. Black described how to create a gas by heating limestone, calling it "fixed air" because it could be fixed back into a solid by combining with lime. He also found that calcium oxide turned into calcium carbonate naturally in the air, so there must be carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.	Joseph Black	Scotland	gas	Science:Chemistry			
galaxy	1755	Galaxy	Are the stars in the sky uniformly distributed, or are they contained in some particular shape? Based on the Milky Way, it seems like the latter. Kant suggested that the Sun was one of many stars in a lens-like shape, and that the Milky Way was what we see when we look along the long axis of the lens. He suggested that there were other galaxies, but this all remained unproven.	Immanuel Kant	Germany	reflecting-telescope	Space			
land-bridges	1756	Land bridges	It was so far assumed that the shape of the continents was fixed and eternal, but Desmarest pointed out similarities of the shores across the English channel, suggesting that the two land masses drifted apart over time. He incorrectly believed these changes were caused by earthquakes.	Nicolas Desmarest	France	sea-navigation	Science:Geology			
halley-comet	1758	Halley's comet	Halley predicted that the comet of 1682 would return in 1758. Amateur astronomer spotted it on Dec 25, 1758. Retrospectively, it turned out that this was the same comet seen by William the Conqueror, and the same one painted by Giotto.	Johann Georg Palitzsch	England	comet-orbits	Space			
flame-tests	1758	Flame tests	It was a difficult task for chemists to distinguish one substance from another. For example, sodium and potassium look similar, but they burn yellow and violet respectively. Further improving the process, Cronstedt introduced a blowpipe which directed a jet of air, making more granular temperature possible.	Andreas Sigismund Marggraf	Germany	nickel	Science:Chemistry			
embryology	1759	Embryology	At the time, it was customary to think that seeds, eggs, pollen, sperm, etc, had miniature organisms in them that grew. Some thought that this was recursive! Wolff found that specialized organs developed out of unspecialized tissue.	Kaspar Friedrich Wolff	Germany	plant-sexuality	Science:Biology			
earthquakes	1760	Earthquakes	Early theories attributed earthquakes to relentless gods or pent-up air underground. The Lisbon quake of 1755 forced more scientifict hinking. Mitchell noted that quakes often correlated to volcanic areas, thought underground water was boiled by volcanic heat, and caused circular waves from the epicenter. Mitchell is considered founder of seismology.	John Mitchell	England	earth-heat	Science:Geology			
heat-capacity	1760	Heat capacity	Heat was considered a special fluid which filled all substances equally based on weight. Black showed that when heating equal weights of mercury and water, mercury's temperature went up twice as fast as the water temperature did.	Joseph Black	Scotland	five-elements, mercury-thermometer	Science:Chemistry			
pathology	1760	Pathology	Morgagni published a list of 640 postmortems fully detailing the lives of his patience, development of disease and manner of death from the anatomical point of view.	Giovanni Battista Morgagni	Italy	cadaver	Science:Biology			
venus-atmosphere	1761	Venus’s atmosphere	Venus didn't appear to have any visual features except when passing directly between sun and earth (called transit of Venus). In an attempt to study Venus' parallax, an expedition was setup to observe it from many different places on earth. This effort failed because the time when venus entered and left the solar shadow could not be determined accurately. Lomonosov suggested this might be due to fuzziness caused by an atmosphere, and was right!	Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov	Russia	reflecting-telescope	Space			
percussion	1761	Medical percussion	Percussion is a method of tapping on a surface to determine the underlying structures, and is used in clinical examinations to assess the condition of the thorax or abdomen.	Leopold Auenbrugger von Auenbrug	Austria	muscles-bones	Science			
latent-heat	1762	Latent heat	Discovery that heat can be absorbed by ice without raising its temperature, leading to the concept of latent heat.	Joseph Black	Scotland	heat-capacity	Science

steam-engine	1764	Steam engine	James Watt repaired and improved a Newcomen steam engine, leading to the first reasonably efficient steam engine. He devised a method for keeping one chamber always hot and another always cold, utilizing latent heat more efficiently, which paved the way for the first truly efficient steam engine.	James Watt	Scotland	latent-heat, newcomen-steam-engine	Science			
plutonism	1765	Plutonism	Nicolas Desmarest suggested that valleys were formed by streams that ran through them, influenced by the heat from volcanic activity.	Nicolas Desmarest	France	earth-heat	Science			
hydrogen	1766	Hydrogen	Demarest discovered hydrogen (which he called 'fire air') through its properties, specifically its high flammability and low density, being one-fourteenth the density of air. His detailed studies on hydrogen's properties led to its eventual recognition as a distinct element.	Henry Cavendish	England	chemical-elements	Science			
experiments-on-nerves	1766	Experiments on nerves	Albrecht von Haller conducted experiments that led to the conclusion of nerves being responsible for muscle movement, not a fluid transmitted through nerves. Haller’s work laid the foundations for modern neurology.	Albrecht von Haller	Switzerland	cadaver	Science			
no-spontaneous-generation-redux	1768	Definitely no spontaneous generation	Lazzaro Spallanzani's experiment further challenged the idea of spontaneous generation by showing no new microorganisms appeared in broth after thoroughly boiling and sealing it.	Lazzaro Spallanzani	Italy	no-spontaneous-generation	Science			
carbonated-water	1768	Carbonated water	Joseph Priestley discovered how to infuse water with carbon dioxide to create carbonated water. This discovery led to the foundation of the soft drink industry.	Joseph Priestley	England	fermentation, carbon-dioxide	General			
quantitative-chemistry	1769	Quantitative chemistry	Lavoisier boiled water for 101 days, observing that sediment appeared and the water did not change its weight, refuting the Greek theory that water could be converted into earth. His precise, quantitative method provided clearer understanding and marked a significant advance in the field of chemistry.	Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier	France	latent-heat	Science			
spinning-frame	1769	Spinning frame	The spinning frame was a mechanical device that could produce strong and hard cotton threads quickly enough to meet the demands of the booming textile industry. His invention made cotton manufacturing faster and more cost-effective, requiring relatively unskilled workers and little money	Richard Arkwright	England	mechanics, flying-shuttle	Design			
nile-river	1770	Nile river	Bruce journeyed upstream to Khartoum in Sudan where he determined the confluence of the White Nile from the southwest and the Blue Nile from the southeast, identifying its source to Ethiopia, which was previously unknown to European explorers.	James Bruce	Scotland		Geography			
gulf-stream	1770	Gulf stream	Franklin, after traveling from America to Europe multiple times, became aware of the difference in eastward and westward sailing times due to ocean currents. He produced a map of the Gulf Stream, beginning of the scientific study of ocean currents.	Benjamin Franklin	England	ocean-navigation	Geography			
soluble-gases	1770	Soluble gases	Priestley became the first person to infuse gases such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride into an upside-down mercury-filled vessel, allowing for the collection of gases that could not be captured through water because they dissolve in water.	Joseph Priestley	England	gas	Science			
nebulas	1771	Nebulas	Initially frustrated by his findings of fuzzy objects that were not comets but rather "nebulosities" fixed in space, he compiled a list of these objects. This list of nebulas includes many star clusters and distant galaxies.	Charles Messier	France	reflecting-telescope, andromeda-nebula	Science			
plants-and-carbon-dioxide	1771	Plants and carbon dioxide	Carbon dioxide was understood to support the respiration of plants, with the notable experiment involving a plant surviving in carbon dioxide-rich air.	Joseph Priestley	England	carbon-dioxide	Science			
combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	1772	Combustion and phlogiston	Chemists of the time thought combustible items contained a substance called phlogiston, from a Greek word meaning 'to set on fire.' Lavoisier began weighing objects in closed volumes and evaluating the volume and weight before and after combustion, refuting the idea that phlogiston was lost and moving towards the understanding of oxygen and its role in combustion.	Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier	France	five-elements	Science			
diamond	1772	Diamond	Antoine Lavoisier burned diamond and observed it in a closed vessel, proving that it was a form of Carbon. He indicated that when it grew hot enough, it simply disappeared, contributing to disprove the phlogiston theory.	Antoine Lavoisier	France	combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	Science			
nitrogen	1772	Nitrogen	Daniel Rutherford asked a question regarding what happens if a candle is burned until no further burning air is possible, which led him to discover a new gas eventually called nitrogen. This gas does not support combustion or sustain life, showing it was neither combustible like oxygen nor able to support life like carbon dioxide.	Daniel Rutherford	England	carbon-dioxide, combustion-and-phlogiston-theory-refinement	Science			
antarctic-circle	1773	Antarctic Circle	The Antarctic Circle was first crossed at sea by Captain James Cook.	James Cook	England	ocean-navigation	Geography			
bacilli	1773	Bacilli	Bacteria could be seen more distinctly than before and categorized by their shapes. Microorganisms were classified into genera and species as per the methods of Linnaeus, particularly identifying rod-shaped bacteria as 'bacilli', spiral-shaped ones as 'spirilla'.	Otto Friedrich Müller	Denmark	microscope, bacteria	Science			
oxygen	1774	Oxygen	Priestley discovered a gas he called 'dephlogisticated air' and eventually oxygen. It allowed combustibles to burn more brilliantly and rapidly than in ordinary air and seemed to have an invigorating effect when inhaled.	Joseph Priestley	England	gas	Science			
chlorine-oxygen	1774	Chlorine oxygen	Scheele isolated the gas chlorine, which was colorless and greenish-yellow in color, named from the Greek word for 'green'. However, Scheele thought it was a combination of some substance with oxygen and did not recognize it as an element, which prevented him from obtaining the credit for its discovery until about thirty years later.	Carl Wilhelm Scheele	Sweden	oxygen	Science			
mesmerism	1774	Mesmerism	Messmer's waved magnets over his patients while reciting prayers, claiming the ability to cure various diseases. Though his methods were discredited, the mind's effect on the body was intriguing and his experiments became the basis of modern hypnosis.	Franz Anton Mesmer	Germany	pathology	Culture			
digitalis	1775	Digitalis	An English physician discovered the medicinal properties of the foxglove plant for heart conditions. The substance obtained was key in treating edema caused by a failing heart, reigniting interest in plant-based medicines.	William Withering	England	medicinal-plants	Science			
races	1776	Races	A classification of the human species into five races was proposed, lead by descriptive criteria such as skin color and physical features without implying any important differences between these groups.	Johann Friedrich Blumenbach	Germany		Culture			
torsion-balance	1777	Torsion balance	The torsion balance uses a fiber or wire's ability to twist under a force to measure weight, providing a way to more precisely measure weight.	Charles-Augustin de Coulomb	France	mechanics	Science			
molybdenum	1778	Molybdenum	Scheele discovered molybdenum, a new chemical element, using methods he had previously applied to isolate another element, manganese.	Scheele	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science			
hawaiian-islands	1778	Hawaiian Islands	Captain Cook explored the Pacific coast of North America and later claimed the Hawaiian Islands for Britain, naming them the Sandwich Islands. This discovery extended British claims in the Pacific region.	James Cook	England	pacific-ocean	Geography			
fertilization	1779	Fertilization	It was discovered that fertilization in humans involved male sperms physically contacting the eggs within the female ovaries, contrary to the prior belief that males provided the 'seed' and females were simply the soil. This newfound understanding clarified that reproduction was a joint process involving contributions from both the mother and father.	Lazzaro Spallanzani	Italy	no-spontaneous-generation	Science			
photosynthesis	1779	Photosynthesis	The process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose, using sunlight as the energy source, was further elucidated. This essential plant function that produces not only oxygen but also complex organic molecules.	Jan Ingenhousz	Netherlands	plants-and-carbon-dioxide	Science			
electrical-stimulation	1780	Electrical stimulation	This invention demonstrated that the muscles of dissected frog legs twitched when struck by a spark from a Leyden jar, suggesting that muscles were activated by electrical impulses. This foundational experiment led to significant insights into bioelectric phenomena in living tissues and laid the foundation for electrophysiology.	Luigi Galvani	Italy	lightning-rod	Science			
uranus	1781	Uranus	The discovery of Uranus expanded our knowledge of the solar system by revealing a seventh planet. This celestial body was initially mistaken for a comet but was identified due to its distinct circular and sharp-edged appearance.	William Herschel	England	telescope	Space			
binary-stars	1781	Binary stars	Two stars sometimes orbit each other due to gravitational forces. The discovery contradicted the earlier belief that close pairs of stars were merely coincidentally aligned, showing that they could in fact be gravitationally bound and move in relation to each other.	William Herschel	England	universal-gravitation	Space			
crystallography	1781	Crystallography	Modern crystallography were established through the discovery that crystal shapes are built from unit cells that stack in a regular pattern spontaneously. 	René-Just Haüy	France	microscope	Science			
mars-axial-tilt	1781	Axial inclination of mars	The axial inclination of Mars was identified, illustrating that like Earth, Mars has a tilted axis which causes seasonal variations similar to those on Earth. The discovery contributed to the understanding of planetary motions and their effects on climate.	William Herschel	England	planet-rotations	Space			
improved-steam-engine	1781	Improved steam engine	Watt's enhancements increased efficiency and power output by recycling steam, maintaining constant cylinder pressure, and enabling use of the engine for driving machinery, which was a pivotal development in the industrial revolution.

Its discovery provided the key to understanding large portions of Egyptian history that were previously obscure.	Napoleon	French	writing	Culture			
electric-battery	1800	Electric battery	Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery, theorizing that electricity originated in metals and not in biological tissue. His invention led to the creation of a continuous electric current, advancing beyond the non-flowing electric charge of static electricity.	Alessandro Giuseppe Volta	Italy	static-electricity	Science	In 1800, Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist, developed the electric battery based on his hypothesis that electricity was a property of metals rather than originating from muscle tissue, as previously thought by Luigi Galvani. Volta's battery harnessed chemical reactions to produce a steady and continuous flow of electricity, which was a significant advance over static electricity and had tremendous implications for the future use and distribution of electrical power. The first batteries used bowls of salt solution to facilitate the chemical reaction needed for the generation of electricity.		
decomposition-of-water	1800	Decomposition of water	This process involved using an electric current to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, revealing the elemental composition of water. It was a foundational experiment demonstrating the use of electricity to drive a chemical reaction.	William Nicholson	England	electric-battery	Science	Following the invention of the Volta's pile, William Nicholson used the battery to pass an electric current through slightly acidified water. The process of electrolysis resulted in the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, confirming that water was composed of these two elements.		
infrared-radiation	1800	Infrared radiation	This discovery identified invisible infrared radiation as a form of light that causes heating effects, extending the known electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. The work was significant for understanding the nature of electromagnetic waves and led to the development of technologies utilizing infrared.	William Herschel	England	binary-stars	Science	Building on previous work in the study of the light spectrum in 1781, an experiment conducted in 1800 showed that upon placing a thermometer just beyond the red end of the visible light spectrum, an increase in temperature was detected despite the absence of visible light. This revealed the presence of a form of light invisible to the human eye, which we now know as infrared radiation.		
gas-lighting	1800	Gas lighting	Gas powered light involved the burning of coal to produce flammable gases, which could be transported and used for illumination. It revolutionized lighting, allowing for the first widespread street and indoor lighting.	William Murdoch	England	candle	Design	The invention of gas lighting by William Murdoch marked the transition from traditional oil and wax based lighting to a system where coal-derived gases could be piped and burned to create light. Murdoch's innovation eventually led to the widespread use of gas lighting in streets and homes, vastly improving illumination and extending productive hours after sundown.		
nitrous-oxide	1800	Nitrous oxide	Nitrous oxide is a gas that induces a state of exhilaration and anesthesia when inhaled, with effects including laughter and pain suppression. It was initially a novelty but found practical use in dentistry as an anesthetic.	Humphry Davy	England	dentistry,oxygen	Science	A British chemist, Humphry Davy, discovered nitrous oxide in 1800. Through his experimental work with the gas, Davy identified its anesthetic properties, reporting a reduction in pain sensation when inhaled. Eventually, it became widely used in dentistry for its anesthetic qualities and was also popularized as a short-lived social fad for its euphoriant effects.		
tissues	1800	Tissues	Careful observations (without a microscope) showed Bichat that the various organs were built up out of a mixture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usually flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues.	Marie François Xavier Bichat	France	cadaver	Science	The French physician Marie François Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) was notable for the many postmortems he conducted in his very short profes- sional life. His careful ob- servations (without a microscope) showed him that the various organs were built up out of a mix- ture of different types of simpler structures, each of which might occur in many different organs. Because these structures were usu- ally flat and delicately thin, they were called tissues. In 1800 he published a book called Treatise on Membranes in which he listed and carefully de- scribed twenty-one differ- ent types of tissues. He is for this reason considered the founder of the science of histology (the study of tis-sues).		
malleable-platinum	1801	Malleable platinum	Wollaston devised a method for making platnium malleable despite its inertness and high melting point. He kept the method secret. Working with platnium he also discovered two other metals very similar in properties to it. These were palladium and rhodium.	William Hyde Wollaston	England	platinum	Science	Platinum, because of its in- ertness and its high melting point, would be marvelously suited to laboratory equipment fi only it could be easily worked and pounded into shape. A method for doing so was worked out by a British chemist, William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828), iHe kept his method secret and never allowed anyone in his laboratory. In this way he earned a fortune. He arranged to have his method published after his death. In working with plati-num, he discovered two other metals very similar in properties to it. These were palladium and rhodium.		
jacquard-loom	1801	Jacquard loom	The Jacquard Loom revolutionized the weaving process by allowing intricate patterns to be woven automatically. It used punched cards to control the loom's needles, enabling it to create complex textile designs with less manual labor.	Joseph-Marie Jacquard	France	flying-shuttle	Design	The Jacquard Loom was an innovation that allowed textiles to be woven with complex patterns without requiring the intensive manual labor that was traditionally necessary. This machine used a series of punched cards, which corresponded to a particular pattern. When these cards were used in the loom, needles would pass through the holes to form the desired pattern in the textile. This automation of pattern weaving not only increased production efficiency but also allowed for the creation of much more intricate designs than were previously feasible by hand weaving.		
discovery-of-ceres	1801	Discovery of Ceres	Ceres was discovered by an Italian astronomer when he serendipitously spotted the object while working at an observatory, and it was notable for being the first known dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This discovery adhered to the predictions made by Bode's law regarding planetary distances.	Giuseppe Piazzi	Italy	jupiter-moons, mars-distance	Space	Ceres was discovered on January 1, 1801, fitting within the framework of Bode's law, which suggested the placement of a planet between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres, though smaller than Mars and more slowly moving, however, turned out to be a dwarf planet and not a full-sized planet as Johann Elert Bode's law had predicted, marking an important contribution to astronomical understanding at the time.		
invertebrates	1801	Invertebrates	Up to now, less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for 'worms"). Lamarck divided the invertebrates into groups like the crustaceans, echinoderms, and distinguished between the eight-legged arachnids and the six-legged insects.	Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck	France	taxonomy	Science	Linnaeus (see 1735) and others in the past three- quarters of a century had elaborated the taxonomy of vertebrates (those animals with backbones-mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fish) in considerable detail. The less familiar and more diverse animals without backbones (invertebrates) were less carefully considered. Linnaeus had lumped them all into the class Vermes (Latin for " 'worms"). The French naturalist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) tackled the problem in publications beginning in 1801. He divided the invertebrates into groups and created such di- visions as the crustaceans(crabs and lobsters) and echinoderms (starfish andsea urchins). He distin-guishedbetween the eight- legged arachnids (spiders and scorpions) and the six-legged insects. In fact, La- marck was the first to usethe terms vertebrate and in-vertebrate, and he popular- ized the term biolog y for the study of life		
ultraviolet	1801	Ultraviolet	This discovery revealed that the spectrum of light extends beyond the visible violet end, where darkening paper soaked in silver nitrate suggested a new type of radiation termed 'ultraviolet' because it is beyond the visible spectrum. The discovery showcased the existence of light that is not visible to the naked eye but has measurable effects.	Johann Wilhelm Ritter	Germany	infrared-radiation	Science	In 1800, an individual working on the study of the spectrum of light realized that soaked paper in silver nitrate darkened rapidly when exposed to the spectrum's end beyond the visible violet spectrum. The effect was less pronounced at the red end of the spectrum, leading to the conclusion that there is radiation beyond the visible spectrum termed 'ultraviolet', indicating its position beyond the violet light. n founding the modrn science of invertebrate zoology, Lamarck began the process of understanding the importance of inverte- brate life. All the verte- brates are included in but a single phylum, while there are about twenty-two phyla of invertebrates. The number of species of insects alone far exceeds the number of species of vertebrates; indeed, it exceeds the number of species of all other animals combined.		
light-waves	1801	Light waves	Young's famous double slit interference experiments with light confirmed its wave-like behavior, demonstrating that light can exhibit patterns of interference similar to waves in water or sound, which supported the wave theory of light.	Thomas Young	England	light-diffraction, light-as-wave	Science	In 1801, an English physicist started a series of experiments that showed light could exhibit wave-like properties through interference patterns. By allowing two beams of light to overlap and interfere with each other, it was proven that light consists of waves of different lengths, which reinforced the argument that light is a wave and not just a particle, challenging previously held notions about the fundamental nature of light.		
discovery-of-niobium	1801	Discovery of niobium	An English chemist discovered a new element within a mineral from the British Museum, initially calling it Columbium (after Columbia, a name for the US), but it later became officially known as niobium. The element's establishment was contentious due to national pride and scientific debate.	Charles Hatchett	England	chemical-elements	Science	Charles Hatchett analyzed a mineral from the British Museum, which was sent there from Connecticut, and identified a new element in 1801. There was a dispute over whether the substance was a new element, but it was finally accepted and officially named niobium, with Hatchett initially calling it columbium in honor of the 'Columbia' (a historical name for the United States). Despite the initial naming, the United States lost the honor of having the element named after it.		
asteroids	1802	Asteroids	This discovery refers to the identification of new celestial bodies between Mars and Jupiter, which were distinct from planets due to their smaller size. They were initially named after Greek deities and later became known as the asteroid belt.	Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers	Germany	discovery-of-ceres	Space	In 1802, following the discovery of Ceres in 1801, German scientists led by Olbers found another celestial body between Mars and Jupiter, naming it Pallas. Further discoveries led to the identification of additional bodies, such as Athena in 1804, and Vesta and Juno in 1807. These bodies were smaller than planets and were eventually realized to be part of a larger collection that would be called asteroids, forming the asteroid belt.		
tantalum	1802	Tantalum	The invention is the discovery of a new metal, which was named after the Greek mythological figure Tantalus. It is a rare, hard, blue-gray metal known for its resistance to corrosion paralleling Tantalus's own unattainable desires.	Anders Gustav Ekeberg	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	Anders Gustav Ekeberg, a Swedish chemist, analyzed minerals from Finland and discovered a new metal in 1802, which he named tantalum. The name was inspired by the Greek mythological figure Tantalus, reflecting the metal's resistance to absorption and corrosion, paralleling Tantalus's own unattainable desires.		
atomic-theory	1803	Atomic theory	The Atomic Theory posits that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms, which combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds. It laid the groundwork for modern chemistry and provided a systematic explanation for chemical reactions based on the combination and rearrangement of atoms.	John Dalton	England	boyles-law	Science	In 1803, an English chemist put forth a comprehensive summary of atomic theory, which suggested that all matter is made up of atoms. This was a more defined, evidence-based approach that built upon Boyle's law and personal investigations. The chemist proposed the idea, for instance, that 8 grams of oxygen would combine with 1 gram of hydrogen to form 9 grams of water, implying that the compound would have a correlating weight. Dalton even utilized the term 'atom' from Democritus but provided a new theory based on experiments and careful chemical observation rather than speculation.		
meteorites	1803	Meteorites	Biot investigated hundreds of supposed meteorite sightings and concluded that the reports were correct and that meteorites did exist and did fall from the sky.	Jean-Baptiste Biot	France	meteorites-hypothesis	Space	Scientist Chladni's work in the late 18th century prompted the scientific community to seriously consider the possibility of meteorites. Following this, Jean-Baptiste Biot confirmed reports of stone falls by examining falls in a region 100 miles west of Paris, arguably laying the foundation for modern planetary science.		
cerium-osmium-iridium	1803	Cerium, Osmium, Iridium	Three new elements were discovered, expanding the periodic table and contributing to the understanding of Earth's composition and the diversity of naturally occurring elements.	Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	New chemical elements, specifically cerium, osmium, and iridium, were discovered in 1803 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius and his colleagues. The discovery of these elements not only broadened the scope of known elements during that period but also provided new substances for study and use in various chemical applications.		
scientific-ballooning	1804	Scientific ballooning	A balloon carrying Biote and Gay-Lussac ascent reached an alpine peak in the Alps (4 miles elevation) to test the composition of the air and to study Earth's magnetic field. This kicked off significant use of balloons for conducting scientific research and marked the beginning of high-altitude explorations.	Jean-Baptiste Biot and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac	France	hot-air-balloon, scientific-voyages	Science	Scientific ballooning began in 1804 when Biote and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac made a balloon ascent reaching a height of 4 miles, reaching an alpine peak in the Alps. This endeavor enabled them to test the composition of the air and to study Earth's magnetic field, contrasting their findings with measurements at sea level, which showed no change, laying the groundwork for future atmospheric explorations.		
steam-locomotive	1804	Steam locomotive	The concept of a steam locomotive was based on the idea that if steam can turn paddle wheels in water, it should be able to turn wheels on land. Early designs faced challenges such as losing too much energy until Trevithick invented iron rails on which the wheels rode. Still he did not reach commercial success.	Richard Trevithick	England	improved-steam-engine	General	The concept of a steam locomotive was based on the idea that if steam can turn paddle wheels in water, it should be able to turn wheels on land. The early steam-powered vehicle faced challenges such as losing too much energy but paved the way for the subsequent development of more efficient steam locomotive designs.		
missouri-river	1804	Missouri River	The Lewis and Clark Expedition explored the Missouri river to its source, onward to the Oregon Territory, then to the Columbia River into the Pacific ocean, the first ocean-to-ocean and back trip across the United States.	Meriwether Lewis and William Clark	United States	america	Geography			
morphine	1805	Morphine	An alcoholic extract of immature opium blooms was called laudanum and had first been introduced by Paracelsus. The chemical eventually named morphene and found much more effective in dulling pain and inducing sleep than the juice itself.	Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Ferdinand Serturner	Germany	mineralogy	Science	Morphine, extracted from opium poppies, was developed as a medication to alleviate severe pain without causing the patient to lose consciousness. It represented a major advancement in pain management and remains one of the most potent analgesics used in medicine today, although it also has the potential for addiction and abuse.		
asparagine	1806	Asparagine	Asparagine was the first amino acid to be isolated, marking a significant milestone in the field of organic chemistry and biochemistry. This discovery laid the groundwork for understanding the role of amino acids in biological systems.	Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin	Germany		Science	In 1806, a substance called asparagine was isolated from asparagus, which was eventually realized to be the first of a set of compounds extremely important to life, known as amino acids. The isolation of asparagine pointed to a broader understanding of the biological importance of amino acids.		
sodium-and-potassium	1807	Sodium and potassium	New elemental metals, sodium and potassium, were isolated using electrolysis, a process that uses an electric current to decompose substances. This breakthrough enabled the isolation of several alkali metals, which had a significant impact on the development of the field of electrochemistry.	Humphry Davy	England	decomposition-of-water	Science	The isolation of sodium and potassium was achieved by passing an electric current through molten potassium carbonate and then through a solution of sodium carbonate. The electrolysis process resulted in the liberation of the metals which were previously unable to be isolated by conventional chemical means. This experiment led to the isolation of the alkali metals barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium in the subsequent year and excited the scientific world, propelling the study of electrochemistry.		
working-steamboat	1807	Practical Steamboat	The completion of the steamboat Clermont marked a significant development in navigable technology, making the steamboat a commercial success. It traveled from New York to Albany in record time, at an avearge speed of 5 mph.	Robert Fulton	United States	steamboat	Design	Robert Fulton is credited with making the steamboat a commercial success, culminating in 1807 with the creation of the Clermont. This steamboat was 133 feet long and could maintain an average speed of nearly 5 miles per hour. With the introduction of the Clermont, the use of steamboats proliferated, enhancing trade and passenger transport on rivers and coastal waters, and setting the stage for the expansion of the steamboat fleet.		
polarized-light	1808	Polarized light	By playing with a crystal of Iceland spar, visible light could be polarized, thus finding that light could exhibit properties similar to that of a magnet with different poles. 	Étienne-Louis Malus	France	double-refraction	Science	The discovery was made when the physicist observed that when sunlight passed through a crystal of Iceland spar, instead of showing double refraction as expected, it produced a single ray of light after passing through the crystal at a certain angle. When the crystal was aligned at right angles to its original direction, a new ray of light appeared while the first ray disappeared; a phenomenon the physicist named polarized light, although his initial assumption about light having poles like magnets turned out to be incorrect.		
mechanism-of-evolution	1809	Mechanism of evolution	Lamarck theorized that the use or disuse of certain body parts by animals could lead to the development of these parts and potentially be inherited by offspring, contributing to evolutionary changes.	Jean-Baptiste Lamarck	France	invertebrates	Science	The theory posited that biological evolution had taken place and could be influenced by organisms' interaction with their environment. For instance, the theory suggested that giraffes developed longer necks to reach leaves, and these traits could be passed on to their offspring. This idea stems from the concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was later shown not to be a mechanism of inheritance. Nonetheless, the publication stirred interest in the field of evolution.		
aerodynamics	1809	Aerodynamics	Cayley visualized flying devices with fixed wings; tails with control surfaces to allow turning and braking, and propulsive mechanisms. 	George Cayley	England	mechanics	Science	The dream of human flight led to the establishment of foundational principles in aerodynamics, with early conceptualizations of flying devices that used fixed wings and appropriate surfaces to interact with air currents for lift, control, and movement. The publications from 1809 by a British scientist began to lay down the theoretical groundwork for these ideas, which would greatly influence the future of flight technology.		
phrenology	1810	Phrenology	Gall proposed that the brain's shape played a major role in its function, and that its shape could be determined by the irregularities and bumps externally visible on the skull. This pseudoscientific discipline was later discredited.	Franz Joseph Gall	Germany	races, brain-areas	Culture	In 1810, German physician Franz Joseph Gall published the first volume of a four-volume treatise on the nervous system, which outlined the foundations of phrenology. Gall believed that mental capacities and different parts of the brain involved with different parts of the human body could be correlated with the shape of the brain. According to this theory, certain brain areas corresponding to certain traits resulted in bulges or indentations on the skull, allowing one to analyze a person’s psychological attributes by examining these bumps on the head.		
chlorine	1810	Chlorine	Up to now, chlorine was considered to be an oxygen-containing compound. Davy showed this was not so, and that chlorine was a distinct element. 	Humphry Davy	England	oxygen, chlorine-oxygen	Science	Chlorine was identified as an element by Davy, refuting prior beliefs that it was a compound containing oxygen as suggested by Scheele. Davy's work on hydrochloric acid showed that chlorine, present within the acid, did not contain oxygen, contrary to the common thought of the time which associated acid properties to the presence of oxygen.		
avogadro-hypothesis	1811	Avogadro's hypothesis	This hypothesis states that all gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles, thereby explaining the relationship between the volume and number of particles of a gas. 	Amedeo Avogadro	Italy	atomic-theory	Science	Avogadro's hypothesis posited that at equal temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain an equal number of particles, regardless of the type of gas. This principle was foundational for developing a deeper understanding of molecular composition and stoichiometry in chemistry. Avogadro suggested that substances like water vapor were composed of molecules, specifically, in water's case, of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and not as single atoms as John Dalton had previously suggested. This idea facilitated the conceptual separation of atoms and molecules and led to essential developments in the molecular theory of gases and compounds.		
iodine	1811	Iodine	Iodine was discovered by a French chemist when he was manufacturing potassium nitrate for gunpowder and accidentally added too much acid to potassium carbonate. This resulted in a beautiful violet vapor that condensed into dark, lustrous crystals. It was suspected to be a new element, confirmed by chemists, and named from the Greek word for 'violet'.	Bernard Courtois	France	gunpowder	Science	While manufacturing potassium nitrate needed in gunpowder, Bernard Courtois added too much acid to potassium carbonate and upon heating, obtained a violet vapor that condensed into dark crystals. After his discovery, he suspected it might be a new element and passed it on for confirmation. It was eventually confirmed and the name 'iodine' was suggested, originating from the Greek word for violet.		
catalysis	1812	Catalysis	Starch was first converted into a sugar (corn syrup), by heating it with sulfuric acid in acid-catalyzed reaction. Since the sulfuric acid was not consumed, it was the first documented example of catalysis in organic chemistry, even though the general concept of catalysis was known (e.g. yeast). 	Gottlieb Sigismund Constantin Kirchhoff	Russia	fermentation	Science	Humans have known since ancient times that substances like yeast can cause reactions indefinitely without being consumed themselves. This concept was further explored by Gottlieb Sigismund Constantin Kirchhoff, who pondered the idea of non-living substances that could catalyze changes, leading to a deeper understanding of chemical reactions.		
catastrophism	1812	Catastrophism	Cuvier's concept of catastrophism was based on the observation that fossils seemed to represent extinct creatures and that the deeper the strata, the less the fossils resembled modern organisms, implying a succession of catastrophic events. Cuvier is considered the founder of paleontology.	Georges Cuvier	France	uniformitarianism	Science	Georges Cuvier's work on catastrophism involved the study of fossils to advance the idea that Earth's natural history was influenced by a series of catastrophic events that led to the mass extinctions of certain life forms, with new forms arising post these events. This challenged the previously dominant view of uniformitarianism and underlined the belief in successive creations in Earth's history.		
universe-as-machine	1812	Universe as machine	Laplace suggested a deterministic universe, proposing that if one knew the position and velocity of every particle, the future and past of the universe could be calculated, eliminating the need for divine intervention. This idea formalized the concept of a universe obeying mechanical laws without exception.	Pierre-Simon Laplace	France	laws-motion, calculating-machines	Science	Pierre-Simon Laplace's theory posited that the universe operates like a vast automatic machine following a predetermined path. According to his hypothesis, by knowing the position and velocity of all particles, one could predict future events which led to the philosophical viewpoint that a mechanistic universe operates without the need for a Godly figure to guide or intervene in natural processes.		
chemical-symbols	1813	Chemical symbols	A system for representing atoms using simple letters was adopted, with single letters or letter pairs denoting elements like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and more complex symbols for compounds. The system simplified the communication and instruction of chemical compositions and continues to be standard in chemistry.	Jöns Jakob Berzelius	Sweden	atomic-theory	Science	With the advancement of atomic theory, there arose the need for a simple method to represent atoms. In 1813, this led to the use of letters, such as H for a hydrogen atom and O for an oxygen atom, among others, as a standardized system for representing chemical elements and compounds, which simplified scientific communication and is still in use today.		
plant-classification	1813	Plant classification	This new plant classification system was a significant part of a large encyclopedia project that improved the system of plant classification beyond that of Linnaeus, providing a more detailed basis for the scientific understanding and categorization of plants.	Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle	France	taxonomy, plant-species-classified	Science	In 1813, French botanist Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle began an ambitious project to catalog plant life, devising an improved system of classification. While only seven of the projected twenty volumes were published before his death, his work built upon and refined Linnaean taxonomy, offering a more detailed plant classification system still in use today.		
spectral-lines	1814	Spectral lines	Meticulously crafted prisms could be used to observe dark lines in the solar spectrum, leading to the identification of nearly six hundred lines. These lines, known as Fraunhofer lines, marked the wavelengths where light was absorbed and became foundational in the fields of chemistry and astronomy for identifying elemental composition.	Joseph von Fraunhofer	Germany	light-spectrum	Science	Since Isaac Newton's initial study of the spectrum in 1666, the understanding of light had not significantly advanced until 1814 when a German physicist crafted precise prisms and observed the solar spectrum through a narrow slit. By observing and mapping the positions of these dark lines, known as Fraunhofer lines, he laid the groundwork for spectroscopy, which would become an essential tool for chemists and astronomers to determine the composition of different materials and celestial bodies.		
plane-of-polarized-light	1815	Plane of polarized light	An experiment showed that two pieces of Iceland spar, if lined up parallel, allow unpolarized light to pass through unimpeded, while if one piece is rotated, the plane of the polarized light must be turned for the light to pass through again. 	Jean-Baptiste Biot	France	polarized-light	Science	In 1815, it was discovered that polarized light could behave differently when it passed through organic substances. Specifically, when Iceland spar (calcite) was used to polarize light, and then the polarized light was passed through an organic liquid, the plane of polarization had to be rotated to allow the light to continue through another piece of Iceland spar. This effect was noted since certain organic liquids caused the light to twist, suggesting an asymmetry in the molecules of organic substances. Important connections were made regarding the interaction between light and the structure of organic molecules.		
organic-radicals	1815	Organic radicals	Through work with poisonous gas hydrogen cyanide, he discovered another gas cyanogen (CN_2), and went to show that carbon-nitrogen or cyano group is very stable and maintained integrity through various chemical changes. A significant contribution to organic chemistry.	Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac	France	chemical-elements	Science	In 1815, a scientific breakthrough occurred with the understanding of organic radicals, which are groups of atoms that remain consistent through different chemical reactions. The discovery that was highlighted is the identification of cyanogen, a carbon-nitrogen compound, which maintained its structural integrity as it transferred as a unit through various chemical reactions. This concept was instrumental in progressing the understanding of organic chemistry and the behavior of organic compounds during chemical changes.		
prouts-hypothesis	1815	Prout's hypothesis	Prout's Hypothesis suggested that all atomic weights are whole number multiples of hydrogen, proposing that hydrogen constitutes the fundamental atom and that other elements are composed of hydrogen atoms. This was a significant step in atomic theory, though it was later proven to be an oversimplification.	William Prout 	England	atomic-theory	Science	An English chemist in 1815 put forward a hypothesis that posited hydrogen as the primary building block of all other elements, suggesting that the atomic weights of elements are integral multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. While this theory greatly influenced the atomic theory, it was eventually refined as inaccuracies were discovered. The concept, however, helped pave the way for our current understanding of atomic structure and elemental composition.		
macadamized-roads	1815	Macadamized roads	Macadamized roads (named after the inventor) improved on older road construction methods and involved laying stones of specific sizes in layers and then compacting them for durability and raising them for proper drainage. They became prominent in Great Britain before spreading to other countries.	John Loudon McAdam	England	paved-road	Design	Paved roads, or 'Macadamized Roads', were invented in 1815 by John Loudon McAdam, who discovered a more efficient road-building method involving laying stones in layers with larger sizes at the base and smaller ones on the surface, followed by compaction with fine gravel or slag. This technique improved upon previous road-building methods by creating a road surface that was elevated above adjacent fields for better water runoff and that was significantly more durable and effective for transportation.		
stethoscope	1816	Stethoscope	The stethoscope is a medical device used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs, and other organs in the human body. It was a significant advancement in diagnostic procedures which previously relied on placing the ear directly to the patient for auscultation.	René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laënnec	France	microscope	Science	Diagnostic procedures were limited in the early days of modern medicine, but one obvious way of getting information was to place the ear to the chest wall and listen to the sound of the heartbeat. In 1816, a French physician, faced with the necessity of listening to the heartbeat of a young woman, invented the stethoscope as a means to maintain decorum and improve the audibility of internal sounds. He used a rolled-up piece of paper to create a tube that amplified these sounds, which he found to be louder compared to directly placing his ear against the patient's chest.		
chlorophyll	1817	Chlorophyll	The discovery of chlorophyll marked a significant advancement in plant chemistry, identifying the substance responsible for the green pigmentation in plants that also plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by trapping sunlight and converting it into energy, which in turn creates plant tissue and oxygen.	Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou	France	photosynthesis	Science	Building on prior research into how plants restore the vitality of air, two scientists in 1817 isolated a green compound from plants that was critical for photosynthesis. This compound, later named chlorophyll, is essential for plants to capture light energy and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, a process fundamental to plant life and the broader ecosystem.		
cadmium-lithium-selenium	1817	Cadmium, Lithium, Selenium	New chemical elements cadmium, lithium, and selenium were isolated, expanding the knowledge of the periodic table and contributing to various scientific and industrial applications.	Friedrich Strohmeyer, Johan August Arfwedson, and Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Germany and Sweden	chemical-elements	Science	Friedrich Strohmeyer discovered cadmium in zinc carbonate while analyzing an impurity that appeared during strong heating, naming it after the Latin word for calamine. Johan August Arfwedson identified lithium in mineral petalite, named after the Greek word for stone, and Jöns Jacob Berzelius discovered selenium in sulfuric acid chamber muds, naming it after the Greek word for moon.		
transverse-light-waves	1818	Transverse light waves	Fresnel suggested that light was a transverse wave, suggesting that it would explain reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Furthermore, a transverse wave would explain polarization.	Augustin-Jean Fresnel	France	light-waves,plane-of-polarized-light	Science	In 1818, a French physicist published a treatise that considered transverse light waves in a detailed mathematical way, showing that such waves would account for reflection, refraction, and diffraction just as well as longitudinal waves. The discovery explained polarized light, which couldn't be elucidated by the previously accepted model of light purely consisting of longitudinal waves.		
enckes-comet	1818	Encke's comet	Encke's Comet was the second comet after Halley's whose cometary orbit had been worked out. This one was the first short-period comet, with a period of 3.3 years, which challenged previous celestial calculations.	Johann Franz Encke	Germany	halley-comet	Space	German astronomer Johann Franz Encke calculated the orbit of a comet that was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons and concluded that it had a short period of return. The comet, now known as Encke's Comet, had its orbit calculated precisely, something no previous comet had achieved.		
atomic-weights	1818	Atomic weights	After thousands of analyses on chemicals, Berzelius published a table of atomic weights. This marked a milestone in the field of chemistry, providing a systematic foundation for the identification and classification of elements.	Jöns Jacob Berzelius	Sweden	chemical-nomenclature	Science	In 1818, a chemist felt justified in publishing a table of atomic weights based on thousands of analyses on various chemicals after years of meticulous work. This table helped standardize chemical weights and contributed to the progress of chemical science by providing a more consistent way to classify and identify elements.		
specific-heat	1819	Specific heat	Each substance requires a certain amount of heat to raise its temperature by 1 degree C. This discovery showed that the specific heat of an element was inversely proportional to its atomic weight.	Pierre-Louis Dulong and Alexis-Thérèse Petit	France	atomic-theory	Science			
steamship	1819	Steamship	The steamship combined steam-powered engine technology with traditional sail-based navigation. Although largely reliant on sails, the steam engine on board opened up new possibilities of travel and trade by providing consistent power, particularly important for gentler rivers where wind conditions could be less favorable.	John Fitch and Robert Fulton	United States	working-steamboat, ocean-navigation	General	The steamboats designed by John Fitch and later improved by Robert Fulton were primarily intended for river travel, utilizing steam engine power to propel the vessel. The notable journey of the American steamship Savannah in 1819 demonstrated the potential of this technology by sailing from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool, England, despite the steam engine being active for only a small portion of the voyage.		
electromagnetism	1820	Electromagnetism	Electrical current flowing through wires creates magnetic fields, which can cause a compass needle to deflect and current-carrying wires to attract or repel each other. This discovery established the foundation of electro-magnetism in physics.	Hans Christian Ørsted 	Denmark	compass	Science	In 1820, it was demonstrated that an electric current creates a magnetic field. When currents flowed in opposite directions through wires placed close together, the wires repelled each other, whereas they attracted each other when the currents flowed in the same direction. This interaction was further illustrated by André-Marie Ampère, who showed that current flowing through a wire bent into a helix could strengthen the magnetic effect, with the helix acting like a magnet with a north pole and a south pole.		
simple-electromagnet	1820	Simple electromagnet	Electromagnetism was improved upon by André-Marie Ampère, who showed that current flowing through a wire bent into a helix could strengthen the magnetic effect, with the helix acting like a magnet with a north pole and a south pole.	André-Marie Ampère	France	electromagnetism	Science			
glycine	1820	Glycine	Glycine is a simple amino acid discovered by heating gelatin with acids, which was eventually found to consist of bound substances that could split apart, revealing a hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen combination distinct from sugars. This discovery was significant in the study of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.	Henri Braconnot	France	catalysis	Science	Following Friedrich Accum and others' work on isolating substances from complex compounds, the substance glycine was identified after gelatin, derived from animals, was heated with acids. It was named glycine from the Greek word for sweet, and it was eventually recognized as an amino acid, not a sugar, due to its chemical composition featuring hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms, unlike sugars which do not contain nitrogen atoms.		
antarctic-land	1820	Antarctic land	This discovery marked the first known sighting of the Antarctic peninsula, a significant landmass north of the Antarctic Circle, by a British naval commander and a Russian explorer in the same geographical region. It contributed to early 19th-century exploration efforts and laid the groundwork for future Antarctic expeditions.	Palmer, Bransfield, Bellingshausen	America, England, Russia	antarctic-circle	Geography	In the year 1820, both a British naval commander named Edward Bransfield and a Russian explorer named Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen claimed to have sighted land in the Antarctic region. While there was no way to know the exact nature of the landscape, it was later realized that they had encountered the Antarctic peninsula. This discovery played a key role in the history of Antarctic exploration and helped to expand geographic knowledge of the previously uncharted region.		
diffraction-gratings	1821	Diffraction gratings	Diffraction gratings are optical components used to disperse light into individual colors or wavelengths, which have largely replaced prisms in the study of light spectra. They are essential in the field of spectroscopy for resolving fine details in the spectrum of emitted or reflected light.	Joseph von Fraunhofer	Germany	light-spectrum	Science	Following experiments with light, diffraction gratings were developed as a means to produce more detailed and precise light spectra than what could be achieved with prisms alone. They consisted of fine, parallel lines scratched on glass, which when illuminated by light, produced detailed spectra by diffracting the light at different angles depending on the wavelength.		
electrical-motion	1821	Electrical motion	This discovery laid the foundation for the relationship between electricity and motion, showing how electric currents can produce mechanical movement. The finding was pivotal in developing electromagnetic technology and influenced many future innovations, including electric motors.	Michael Faraday	England	electromagnetism	Science	The discovery of electromagnetism continued to trigger a surge of experimentation, particularly with Michael Faraday's setup of an electrical circuit that included two wires and two magnets. The experimentation showed that when an electric current passed through a wire, it could cause motion in a nearby magnet or wire, thus demonstrating for the first time that electricity can produce mechanical motion in controlled circumstances.		
seebeck-effect	1821	Seebeck effect	The Seebeck effect is the first demonstration of thermoelectricity, generating a voltage difference in a circuit composed of two different metals that are connected at two places with different temperatures. This effect found applications in power generation and temperature measurement	Thomas Johann Seebeck	Germany	electromagnetism	Science	German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered in 1821 that when two different metals were joined at two places and kept at different temperatures, an electric current would be generated. This finding is crucial for understanding thermoelectric effects and is the basis for technologies such as thermocouples and thermoelectric generators.		
glaciers	1821	Glaciers	Venetz suggested that Glaciers must, at some time in the past, have extended far beyond their present limits, explaining why striation patterns resembling glacier movement were found so far from present glaciation.	Ignatz Venetz	Switzerland	popular-mountain-climbing	Geography	The section on Glaciers discusses how these massive ice forms were observed to move like rivers of ice down mountainsides, with geologists also noting striations in rocks caused by their movement. A Swiss geologist published material in 1821 proposing that glaciers once extended much further than they do in modern times; however, the idea did not gain immediate traction.		
fourier-analysis	1822	Fourier analysis	Fourier's theorem outlined the flow of heat and introduced the concept of using sinusoidal components to break down any periodic function, which became the foundation for the field of Fourier analysis. This work significantly advanced the understanding of heat transfer and laid the groundwork for modern signal processing.	Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier	France	calculus	Math	The 1822 publication by French mathematician Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier presented his 'Analytical Theory of Heat', which explained how heat flows using sinusoidal series to express any periodic function. Fourier's work established the technique of dimensional analysis and indicated that the basic set of units should be mass, length, and time, from which other units are derived.		
analytical-engine	1822	Analytical engine	The Analytical Engine was an early mechanical general-purpose computer. It was designed to perform any kind of calculation or logical operation automatically by using punched cards.	Charles Babbage	England	jacquard-loom	Science	Around 1822, Charles Babbage began developing the concept for a machine capable of performing a wide range of calculations by mechanical means, including the use of punched cards. Although a full operational version was never completed in his lifetime, the design of the Analytical Engine laid the groundwork for future computers, being able to perform sequential operations and print results.		
projective-geometry	1822	Projective geometry	Projective geometry is a foundational part of modern geometry dealing with properties and principles that are invariant under projection transformations. Roughly it is the study of the shadows cast by geometric figures.	Jean-Victor Poncelet	France	analytic-geometry	Math	While he was a prisoner of war during Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, Jean-Victor Poncelet reflected on the properties of geometric figures under projection, leading to publications that established the discipline of projective geometry, which studies the relationships between shapes as they appear in perspective or when projected onto various surfaces.		
iguanodon	1822	Iguanodon	The Iguanodon was a significant discovery in paleontology, being a large ancient reptile whose name reflects its iguana-like teeth. As it turned out, this was the first of what would eventually be called dinosaurs.	Gideon Mantell	England		Science	In 1822, Gideon Mantell made a groundbreaking discovery when he identified the bones and teeth resembling those of an iguana, but much larger, which turned out to be from a previously unknown large ancient reptile later named 'Iguanodon'. It was one of the earliest recognitions of what would become classified as dinosaurs.

Jean-François Champollion	France	rosetta-stone	Culture	Jean-François Champollion made a monumental stride in 1822 by deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphs, realizing some symbols were alphabetic, some syllabic, and others represented a whole word or idea. This discovery established the field of Egyptology, enabling the interpretation of texts from ancient Egyptian civilization.		
gastric-acidity	1823	Gastric acidity	Prout discovered that stomach hydrochloric acid is part of what permits digestion without harming the stomach lining. This challenged the vitalist theory by showing the presence of such a strong acid within living organisms.	William Prout	England	digestion, acids	Science	In 1823, it was discovered that human stomach secretions contained hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid involved in the digestive process. This acid is part of living beings and aids in digestion without damaging the stomach lining, posing a significant question against the vitalist theory which posited a clear distinction between the chemicals of living organisms and those of nonliving matter.		
platinum-as-catalyst	1823	Platinum as catalyst	Döbereiner discovered that hydrogen gas ignites in the presence of powdered platinum without the platinum being consumed, which laid the groundwork for the idea of metal catalysis in chemical reactions. This led to the innovation of an automatic lighter and has significant implications for industrial chemistry.	Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner	Germany	catalysis, malleable-platinum	Science	As early as 1816, it had been noted that platinum seemed to help ignite and burn hydrogen more readily, but in 1823, the effect of powdered platinum acting as a catalyst was observed. It was found that the platinum wasn't consumed in the process. Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner's observation of this phenomenon led to further developments in catalysis and the invention of an automatic lighter, propelling the use of catalysts in industrial chemical reactions.		
isomers	1823	Isomers	One chemist studying silver isocyanate, and another studying silver fulminate submitted their findings to a scientific journal whose editor realized that both compounds had the same number of atoms but vastly different properties because of their respective arrangement.	Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig	Germany	atomic-theory	Science	Isomerism was identified as a phenomenon where substances with the same molecular formula possess different chemical properties due to varying arrangements of atoms.

This process allowed for more detailed studies of gases and facilitated advancements in various industrial and scientific applications, including refrigeration.		
electromagnets	1823	Electromagnets	An electromagnet was created by insulating an iron bar and winding coiled wire around it. When electricity was introduced, it generated a strong magnetic field. His device would lift 9 pounds —twenty times its own weight while the current was running.	William Sturgeon	England	simple-electromagnet	Science	An electromagnet was created by insulating an iron bar and winding coiled wire around it. When electricity was introduced, it generated a strong magnetic field, which spurred further innovations in electrical engineering and paved the way for the development of electric motors and generators.		
portland-cement	1824	Portland cement	Portland Cement was superior to previous materials used for the same purpose because it could better withstand the elements. This new formulation involved burning clay and limestone together, and it quickly became fundamental in construction due to its strength and cost-effectiveness	Joseph Aspdin	England	steel, coke-iron	General	In 1824, Portland Cement was invented by an English stonemason, which was superior to previous materials used for the same purpose because it could better withstand the elements.

steam-engine-efficiency	1824	Steam engine efficiency	The study of steam engine efficiency led to the understanding that the maximum efficiency of a steam engine is governed by the temperature difference between the steam at its hottest and the cold water at its coldest. This work laid the groundwork for thermodynamics and the principles of heat engines.	Nicolas-Léonard-Sadi Carnot	France	improved-steam-engine	Science	In 1824, a book titled 'On the Motive Power of Fire' elaborated on the principles governing steam engine efficiency, revealing that the vast majority of energy from fuel was wasted as heat. The insights gained from this work by a French physicist were critical in paving the way for future advancements in steam engine technology and the broader field of thermodynamics.		
distance-of-the-sun	1824	Distance of the Sun	The distance of the Sun from Earth was recalculated to be 95,300,000 miles, off by only 2.6%	Johann Franz Encke	Germany	mars-distance	Space	Using the transit of Venus to calculate the Sun's parallax, the distance from Earth to the Sun was revised and provided a more accurate measurement than Cassini's prior estimation. This was a significant improvement in astronomical knowledge and helped refine further calculations in celestial mechanics.		
no-quintic-equation	1824	No quintic equation	It was conclusively determined that quintic equations, which are polynomial equations of the fifth degree, cannot be solved by radicals (general solutions using algebraic methods).	Niels Henrik Abel	Norway	cubic-equations,heptadecagon	Math	After prolonged efforts by mathematicians to solve quintic equations, or polynomial equations of the fifth degree, it became clear that these equations could not be solved by radicals. This discovery was an important milestone in the development of algebra and influenced the study of equations and their solvability.

Hans Christian Ørsted	Denmark	microscope, atomic-weights	Science	The isolation of aluminum was a notable scientific achievement, considering that aluminum is extremely difficult to extract from its compounds. Being the first to isolate aluminum, this discovery laid the groundwork for subsequent research and led to aluminum becoming one of the most widely used metals once a cheaper method of obtaining it in quantity was devised.		
gastric-digestion	1825	Gastric digestion	The study of gastric digestion through observation of a Canadian patient with a unique wound and inch-wide fistula leading into his stomach provided early insights into the digestive process and sparked interest in the field.	William Beaumont	United States	gastric-acidity	Science	Following a gunshot wound that resulted in a fistula, a patient's stomach became accessible for direct observations. This circumstance allowed for unprecedented observation and study of the digestive process in action, which led to greater understanding of digestion and had a significant impact on medical science.

doppler-effect	1842	Doppler effect	The Doppler Effect is a scientific discovery that explains the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source, noting the change in pitch of a locomotive's whistle as it approaches and then recedes from the observer, as a primary example.	Christian Johann Doppler	Austria	steam-locomotive-improved	Science	The discovery of the Doppler Effect was crucial in understanding how the perceived frequency of a wave, such as sound or light, changes when the source of the wave and the observer move relative to each other. An Austrian physicist named Christian Johann Doppler described this principle, noting the change in pitch of a locomotive's whistle as it approaches and then recedes from the observer, as a primary example. The Doppler Effect helps explain a variety of natural phenomena and has significant implications in areas like astronomy (e.g., redshift) and radar speed detection.		
cranial-index	1842	Cranial Index	Following Blumenbach's idea of races, Retzius suggested a using the ratio of skull width to skull length. An index of less than .8 was called dolichocephalic (long head) and greater was called brachycephalic (broad head). This failed attempt to split the human species into smaller groups only encouraged racism and ethnocentricity.	Anders Adolf Retzius	Sweden	races	Science			
mechanical-equivalent-of-heat	1843	Mechanical equivalent of heat	This concept established the relationship between mechanical work and heat, demonstrating that energy could be converted from one form to another but not created or destroyed. It was a foundational principle in the field of thermodynamics that quantified the amount of work needed to produce a specific quantity of heat.	James Prescott Joule	England	conservation-of-mass	Science	A British physicist decided to explore the relationship between work and heat through extensive experimentation. In 1843, he published findings that quantified the amount of work needed to generate a specific quantity of heat, an effort which established the mechanical equivalent of heat. This principle underpinned the conservation of energy and contributed significantly to the field of thermodynamics.		
sunspot-cycle	1843	Sunspot cycle	The periodic change in the sun's activity, including variations in the number of sunspots and a 10-year cycle (later refined to 11-year on average) was characterized during this time.	Samuel Heinrich Schwabe	Germany	sunspots	Space	While sunspots were initially observed by Galileo, it wasn't until this period that the cyclic nature of sunspot activity began to attract attention. The understanding that sunspots increased and decreased in a somewhat regular cycle imparted vital insights into solar behavior and its potential impact on Earth.		
quaternions	1843	Quaternions	Quaternions are an extension of complex numbers represented as points involving four numbers, which revolutionized three-dimensional computations and physics. They provided a new mathematical framework, paving the way for future developments in algebra and geometry.	William Rowan Hamilton	Ireland	imaginary-numbers	Math	In 1843, it was shown that complex numbers could be treated as points in a plane, and that each could be represented by two numbers. Hamilton tried to deal with hypercomplex numbers that could be represented as points in three or more dimensions and devised quaternions, represented by four numbers.		
higher-analytic-geometry	1843	Higher analytic geometry	Higher analytic geometry is an extension to n-dimensional spaces, providing a fundamental tool in understanding geometric properties and behaviors beyond two and three dimensions. It built upon previous work in analytic geometry and increased the potential for mathematical exploration in multiple dimensions.	Arthur Cayley	England	analytic-geometry, quaternions	Math	In 1843, Cayley worked out analytic geometry in three or more dimensions, which would be called n-dimensional analytic geometry. This was based on extending analytic geometry work in two dimensions, expressed by algebraic equations.		
wheatstone-bridge	1843	Wheatstone bridge	The Wheatstone Bridge (named after its popularizer, not original inventor) is an electrical circuit used to measure unknown electrical resistances with high accuracy. It became a critical instrument in scientific research and electrical engineering.	Charles Wheatstone	England	ohms-law	Design	In 1843, the Wheatstone Bridge, although not invented by Wheatstone himself, garnered recognition when it became popular and widely introduced by him. The Wheatstone bridge measures the resistance of a circuit very delicately by balancing a number of currents against each other.		
transatlantic-liner	1843	Transatlantic liner	The S.S. Great Britain is recognized as the first modern ocean liner, featuring an iron hull and a screw propeller, marking the start of a new era in transatlantic travel. It significantly improved maritime transport efficiency and comfort, influencing future ship design.	Isambard Kingdom Brunel	England	screw-propeller, ocean-navigation	Design	The first ship seen as a modern transatlantic liner was the S.S. Great Britain, launched on July 19, 1843. It was 322 feet long, had a crew of 130, and featured an iron hull and screw propeller, setting new standards for shipbuilding and transoceanic travel.		
telegraph	1844	Telegraph	The telegraph is a communication system that transmits textual messages through electrical signals over wires. It facilitated rapid long-distance communication and had a significant impact on many aspects of society, including commerce, news dissemination, and military operations.	Samuel Morse	United States	morse-code, electromagnets	Science	In order to maintain the signal over long distances, the telegraph used a relay system invented in 1835. Electricity would pass through a wire, activating an electromagnet to pull on a telegraph key. This action would close a second circuit with its own battery, allowing a strong enough signal to engage another relay and continue the message transmission. Thus, messages could be relayed over vast distances by a network of wires and relays, providing nearly instantaneous communication across extended regions.		
companion-of-sirius	1844	Companion of Sirius	Astronomers discovered a companion star to Sirius, indicating that some stars have dark companions which are not luminous enough to be visible. This discovery suggested that stars can be influenced by gravitational pull from unseen objects, a concept which extended our understanding of stellar systems and their components.	Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel	Germany	stellar-motion, distance-of-stars	Space	The Companion of Sirius refers to the discovery of a star in close proximity to Sirius that followed an irregular path, suggesting the presence of an unseen gravitational influence. Astronomers like Bessel surmised that the erratic motions of certain stars near the end of their lives, such as Sirius and Procyon, indicated they were being influenced by unseen, non-luminous companions—later understood to be white dwarf stars or other dark celestial bodies.		
astraea	1845	Astraea	Astraea is an asteroid discovered after a long systematic search, marking the first newfound asteroid in nearly four decades and rekindling interest in asteroid hunting.	Karl Ludwig Hencke	Germany	asteroids	Space	The German amateur astronomer Karl Ludwig Hencke conducted a systematic search after 1830 and, after fifteen years of failure, discovered the asteroid named Astraea in 1845. This discovery came after a significant hiatus since the discovery of the first four asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta), challenging the assumption that no other asteroids existed.		
spiral-nebulas	1845	Spiral nebulas	Using a telescope with a 72" wide mirror, Parsons observed spiral structures in certain nebulas provided a new understanding of galactic formations and laid the groundwork for future astronomical discoveries.	William Parsons	Ireland	nebular-hypothesis	Space	Before 1845, nebulae in the sky appeared amorphous without discernible structure. However, observations made in 1845, using more advanced telescopes, revealed that some nebulae had spiral structures, a significant breakthrough in astronomy that hinted at the complex composition of distant galaxies.		
permanent-gases	1845	Permanent gases	The term 'permanent gases' was coined for a group of gases that resisted liquefaction under higher pressures, challenging chemists with new boundaries of chemical experimentation.	Michael Faraday	England	liquefying-gases	Science	In 1845, Michael Faraday's experiments to liquefy gases previously thought impossible to liquify, such as oxygen and nitrogen, resulted in the identification of these gases which remained gaseous under the conditions applied. This discovery influenced future research and methods for gas manipulation and contributed to the advancement of physical chemistry.		
anesthesia	1846	Anesthesia	The development of anesthesia involved the use of substances such as ether to induce unconsciousness and sensitize patients for pain-free operations. It revolutionized medicine by allowing more complex and longer surgeries to be performed without causing pain to the patient.	William Thomas Green Morton	United States	chloroform, hypnotism	Science	The development of anesthesia involved the use of substances such as ether to induce unconsciousness and sensitize patients for pain-free operations. While initial experiments were conducted in the 1840s, it wasn't until an American dentist, William Thomas Green Morton, publicly demonstrated the use of ether on a patient in 1846 that the practice was adopted into mainstream medicine.		
neptune	1846	Neptune	Neptune is a distant planet discovered due to irregularities in Uranus's orbit, which suggested the gravitational influence of another planet. It was observed for the first time in 1846, helped by calculations of its possible location due to these perturbations.	John Couch Adams, Urbain-Joseph Le Verrier	England, France	uranus	Space	The planet Uranus was found to have irregularities in its orbit, leading astronomers to predict the presence of Neptune based on gravitational influences on Uranus. Initial predictions were made and refined leading to the eventual observation of the planet in 1846, confirming the existence of the then-unknown planet. Neptune was named after the Roman god of the sea and was significant for showing that objects in our solar system could still be discovered.		
vulcan	1846	Vulcan	Vulcan was a hypothetical planet proposed to exist inside Mercury's orbit to account for peculiarities in Mercury's orbit, suggested by its perihelion shift. The planet was never found and the anomalies in Mercury's remained a mystery for seventy years.	Urbain-Joseph Le Verrier	France	neptune	Space	The search for Vulcan arose from the observation of Mercury's orbit behaving in a way not entirely explained by Newtonian mechanics. The planet Vulcan was postulated to exist closer to the Sun than Mercury. The concept was seriously considered following its proposal, with an aim to seek the planet beginning in 1846, but it was ultimately concluded to not exist after the phenomenon was explained by Einstein's theory.		
crystal-asymmetry	1846	Crystal asymmetry	Molecular asymmetry was discovered as a fundamental characteristic in certain molecules that can cause polarized light to twist in different directions. This discovery laid the groundwork for the field of stereochemistry several decades later.	Louis Pasteur	France	plane-of-polarized-light	Science	In 1846, a breakthrough in understanding molecular structure was achieved when it was found that certain organic molecules called tartarates could twist polarized light clockwise or counterclockwise depending on their asymmetrical structure. The study revealed that two forms of the same substance could have opposite optical effects, which was later understood to be due to the presence of chirality, a concept crucial to stereochemistry.		
protoplasm	1846	Protoplasm	Protoplasm was identified as the vital substance within plant cells responsible for various aspects of life, including growth and development. The discovery of protoplasm enhanced the understanding of the fundamental makeup of cell structure.	Hugo von Mohl	Germany	cell-theory	Science	Hugo von Mohl (1805–1872), a German botanist, discovered that typical plant cells contain a granular colloidal substance, which he termed protoplasm in 1846. This material, which comprises the living part of the cell, was recognized for its essential role in cell function, representing a significant advancement in cell biology and physiology.		
cuneiform-decipherment	1846	Cuneiform decipherment	The decipherment of cuneiform script opened up understanding of ancient Mesopotamian cultures, providing insight into their language, history, and civilization. This linguistic breakthrough enabled the translation of countless tablets and inscribed artifacts.	Henry Rawlinson	England	rosetta-stone	Geography	In the 19th century, cuneiform, an ancient writing system used in Mesopotamia, was deciphered by linguists and archaeologists. Henry Rawlinson, a British army officer and scholar, played a pivotal role in this achievement, leading to a significant expansion of knowledge about early human civilizations.		
sewing-machine	1846	Sewing machine	The sewing machine was devised to make a device small enough for the home that could sew stitches using a needle and a shuttle. It revolutionized home and industrial sewing, greatly reducing the time and effort required for creating garments.	Elias Howe	United States	jacquard-loom	Design	Prior to the invention of the sewing machine, weaving machines for cloth patterns existed, but there was a need for a more compact and convenient device for use in the home. The first successful model that caught on used a needle and shuttle to create stitches and outperformed manual sewing methods, hence gaining popularity and becoming a key product of the Industrial Revolution that eased household sewing tasks.		
conservation-of-energy	1847	Conservation of energy	This fundamental principle states that the total amount of energy in the Universe is constant, where energy cannot be created or destroyed but can change forms, such as between mechanical, electrical, and chemical energies. The law signifies a foundational concept in the field of physics and underscores the interconvertibility of various forms of energy.	Hermann von Helmholtz	Germany	mechanical-equivalent-of-heat	Science	The law of conservation of energy, proposed in the mid-19th century, asserts that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant over time. It indicates that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transferred or transformed from one form to another. This principle has become a cornerstone of physics, guiding the understanding of energy dynamics across all natural processes.		
puerperal-fever	1847	Puerperal fever	Puerperal fever is an infection that historically affected childbearing women, often leading to severe illness and death, and it was discovered that cross-contamination from doctors treating multiple patients could exacerbate the spread of the disease. The recognition of this contagious nature of the fever prompted improved sanitary practices in medical care.	Ignaz Phillipp Semmelweiss 	Hungary	pathology	Science	The recognition of puerperal fever, or childbed fever, as a contagious condition marked an important step in medical science, emphasizing the importance of hygiene and sanitation in the prevention of the spread of infections. This discovery led to the understanding that doctors could inadvertently transfer bacteria from one patient to another, influencing the development of antiseptic techniques and a shift toward better sanitary practices in hospitals and childbirth procedures.		
painless-childbirth	1847	Painless childbirth	The invention allowed for painless childbirth by using a certain anesthesia, which was a groundbreaking advancement for obstetrics.	James Young Simpson	England	screw-propeller	Science	A British obstetrician discovered the ability to administer anaesthesia to women in childbirth, providing a much less dangerous and traumatic experience than the prevalent methods at the time. This practice was adopted quickly and became a transformative development for both healthcare providers and expectant mothers.		
nitroglycerine	1847	Nitroglycerine	Initially discovered by accidentally mixing nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table, nitroglycerine was further improved and stabilized to be used in construction and warfare, hence beginning the modern era of explosives.	Christian Friedrich Schönbein	Germany	gunpowder	Science	Initially discovered by Christian Friedrich Schönbein when he accidentally created a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids on his kitchen table, nitroglycerine was further improved and stabilized to be used in construction and warfare, hence beginning the modern era of explosives.		
symbolic-logic	1847	Symbolic logic	Symbolic Logic is a system that leverages symbols and operations analogous to algebra to represent and solve logical arguments. Its development has essential applications in areas such as mathematics and computer programming.	George Boole	England	calculus	Math	In 1847, George Boole published 'The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,' formulating a system that applies a set of symbols to logical operations. This method resembles algebra, allowing logical arguments to be manipulated and solved symbolically, which laid the groundwork for later developments in mathematics and computer science.		
silver-fillings	1847	Silver fillings	Silver fillings are a dental innovation enabling the restoration of teeth damaged by decay. This technique involves filling the cavities with silver amalgam to prevent further deterioration.	Thomas Wilberger Evans	United States	dentistry	Science	Thomas Wilberger Evans introduced the use of silver amalgam for fillings in 1847. This method restored teeth that had cavities due to decay, offering a durable solution for maintaining dental health.		
absolute-zero	1848	Absolute zero	Absolute Zero is the theoretical lowest temperature possible, where gas volume decreases to zero and all thermal motion ceases. The Kelvin scale measures the Celsius degree of heat that the freezing point of water would be 273.15 K, and it has since been essential in thermodynamics for providing an absolute scale.	Baron Kelvin	England	gas-volume-temperature, celsius, charles-law	Science	British physicist William Thomson, later known as Baron Kelvin, pointed out in 1848 the significance of energy loss affecting not only gases but also liquids and solids. The concept of Absolute Zero reflects a state where temperature can be indefinitely lowered, and all kinetic activity halts, leading to the Kelvin scale of temperature.		
crab-nebula	1848	Crab Nebula	Using large new telescopes, the Crab Nebula was identified as a remnant of a bright new star first observed in 1054. It was noted for its irregular shape resembling a crab. Its study has been instrumental in astronomical research and has solidified the importance of the event it represents in history.	Lord Rosse	England	spiral-nebulas	Space	In 1848, using a giant telescope, Lord Rosse studied the first nebulosity (M1) on the list Messier had prepared since 1771. He observed a patch of a curiously irregular shape that seemed to have numerous crooked legs like those of a crab, leading him to call it the 'Crab nebula'—a name that has been preserved. This marked an important step in understanding the remnants of supernovas and their role in the cosmos.		
spectral-line-shift	1848	Spectral line shift	The spectral line shift or Doppler-Fizeau effect describes the change in wavelength and frequency of light from a source due to its relative motion, which impacts the study of motion and velocity in astronomy. The red shift indicates objects in space receding from the viewer, while the blue shift suggests an approaching motion.	Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau	France	doppler-effect	Science	Building on the Doppler effect with respect to sound that had been described in 1842, physicist Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau proposed in 1848 that the concept could be applied to the waves of light as well. This shift in light's spectral lines could show a shift towards red if the light source is receding or a shift towards blue in case of an approaching light source, enabling better understanding of the universe's expansion and motion of celestial bodies.		
speed-of-light-experiment	1849	Speed of light refraction	The speed of light was determined more accurately using an earthbound experiment involving a toothed wheel and mirrors. Foucault's best figure was off by just 0.7 percent. He also found that light traveling through water traveled only three-fourths as fast as through air.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	speed-of-light, aberration-light, spectral-line-shift	Science	Using an improved method involving a toothed wheel and two mirrors, one stationary and the other rotating, scientists were able to measure the speed of light with increased precision. Light was reflected from the stationary mirror to the rotating one and the timing of the reflection was measured, which allowed for a more accurate speed of light calculation.		
roche-limit	1849	Roche limit	The Roche limit refers to the critical distance within which celestial bodies, like Saturn's rings, would disintegrate due to tidal forces rather than accrete into a larger body due to gravitational attraction. This concept explains why certain astronomical bodies form rings instead of coalescing into moons or planets.	Edouard Roche	France	universal-gravitation, saturn-rings	Space	The Roche Limit is a concept in celestial mechanics introduced in 1849. It addresses the effect of tidal forces on an object when it is in a close orbital proximity to a larger body, such as a planet. If an object, such as a satellite or ring particle, orbits within this limit, tidal forces overcome the gravitational forces holding it together, and it may break up and disperse, often forming rings rather than a single body. The Roche Limit has helped to understand the formation and nature of rings around planets like Saturn.		
nerve-fibers	1849	Nerve fibers	Discovery that nerve fibers are prolonged outgrowths of cells strengthened the cell theory, highlighting the direct extension of cells in the formation of nerves. This finding contributed significantly to the understanding of the nervous system structure.	Rudolf Albert von Kölliker	Germany	cell-theory	Science	In 1849, it was revealed that nerve fibers are actually elongated outgrowths of cells. This discovery was pivotal as it supported and reinforced the developing cell theory, illustrating that not only do cells serve as the fundamental units of life, they also directly extend to form more complex structures such as the nerves in the nervous system. Prior to this, the composition of nerves and how they related to cells were not fully understood.		
safety-pin	1849	Safety Pin	Improved pin design included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place.	Walter Hunt	United States	steel	Design			
reinforced-concrete	1849	Reinforced Concrete	Monier, a commercial gardener, experimented with iron-wire reinforcement for his cement and concrete tubs and basins, making it much stronger.	Joseph Monier	France	steel	Design			
second-law-of-thermodynamics	1850	Second law of thermodynamics	The Second Law of Thermodynamics formalizes the observation that energy in a closed system tends to become less useful over time, a concept also known as entropy. This principle is fundamental in predicting the direction of natural processes and understanding the limits of energy conversion and work.	Rudolf Clausius	Germany	conservation-of-energy, steam-engine-efficiency, thermochemistry	Science	After the establishment of the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is the law of conservation of energy, the Second Law points out that in any closed system, no energy can be destroyed, but it tends to be spread out and degraded over time, leaving less and less energy in a useful form. German physicist Rudolf Clausius, and later, physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, contributed to refining this concept, stating that while energy remains constant, the entropy of the universe always increases, leading to a gradual decay of available energy for doing work.		
infrared-waves	1850	Infrared waves	The discovery of infrared waves unveiled a type of radiation beyond the visible spectrum, detectable due to its heating effects and possessing similar wave properties as visible light. This discovery broadened the understanding of electromagnetic radiation and led to the development of various applications utilizing infrared technology.	Macedonio Melloni	Italy	infrared-radiation	Science	Infrared waves were discovered as a form of light that lies outside the visible spectrum, characterized by longer wavelengths that can cause heating effects and are detectable by sensitive instruments. The detection and study of infrared radiation opened new avenues in scientific research and practical applications, such as thermal imaging and remote sensing.		
rotation-of-the-earth	1851	Rotation of the earth	Ever since the time of Copernicus, it had been assumed that the Earth rotates on its axis, but no one had proven it. Foucault suspended a large iron ball inside the dome of a large church. The pendulum ended in a spike that would mark the floor as it swung, showing the changing orientation of the swing.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	heliocentric-practice	Science	Ever since the time of Copernicus, it had been assumed that the Earth rotates on its axis, but no one had proven it. In 1851, Foucault suspended a large iron ball inside the dome of a large church. The pendulum ended in a spike that would mark the floor as it swung, demonstrating Earth's rotation by the changing orientation of the pendulum's swing. The experiment showed that in Paris, it would take 31 hours and 47 minutes for the pendulum to complete a full rotation, visually proving Earth's rotation to observers.		
ariel-and-umbriel	1851	Ariel and umbriel	Lassell discovered a third and fourth satellite of Uranus, naming them after spirits in English literature (Shakespeare and Pope).	William Lassell	England	uranus-satellites	Space	The last large satellite, Triton, had been discovered five years before 1851, but there were smaller satellites to be found. In 1848, Lassell had discovered an eighth satellite of Saturn named Hyperion. The year 1851 saw the discovery of two more satellites by an American astronomer, Ariel and Umbriel, adding to the growing knowledge of planetary satellites.		
joule-thomson-effect	1852	Joule-thomson effect	The Joule-Thomson effect demonstrated how a gas cools when it expands if kept insulated from external energy sources. This effect later facilitated the liquefaction of permanent gases.	James Prescott Joule and William Thomson	England	second-law-of-thermodynamics	Science	In 1852, Joule and Thomson were able to show that if a gas was allowed to expand, it consumed energy, because the molecules had to separate against a certain tendency to cling together. If energy were kept from entering the gas, the energy for expansion would have to come from the gas itself, and the temperature would drop. This came to be called the Joule-Thomson effect and would later be used to liquefy some of the permanent gases.		
valence-theory	1852	Valence theory	The valence theory explained how elements combine with fixed numbers of other atoms according to specific rules. The notion of valence imposed a new kind of order on the elements, because valence seemed to change regularly with the arrangement of atoms in the periodic table.	Edward Frankland	England	atomic-theory	Science	Chemists knew that elements had different capacities for combining with other elements. For instance, an oxygen atom would combine with two hydrogen atoms to form water, a nitrogen atom would combine with three hydrogen atoms to form ammonia, and a carbon atom would combine with four hydrogen atoms to form methane. This was not studied closely and systematically, however, until an English chemist, Edward Frankland, studied organometallic compounds. He could not help noticing the manner in which metallic atoms combined with organic compounds, and how each different kind of atom would almost invariably hook onto a fixed number of other atom groupings. In 1852 he published his theory of what came to be called valence, pointing out that a particular atom had the power to combine with fixed numbers of other kinds of atoms according to simple rules. The notion of valence imposed a new kind of order on the elements, because valence seemed to change regularly with the arrangement of atoms in the periodic table.		
gyroscope	1852	Gyroscope	A massive rotating sphere that maintains its axis of spin direction, used for steady navigation. It provided a more reliable means of indicating true north than the magnetic compass.	Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault	France	rotation-of-the-earth, compass	Science	A demonstration was made with a heavy rim (a gyroscope) set to rapid rotation. It maintained its axial direction even when tipped, counteracting gravity to maintain steady orientation, thus substituting the magnetic compass for accurate navigation.		
sunspots-and-earth	1852	Sunspots and earth	The discovery linked disturbances in Earth's magnetic field with the increase and decrease of sunspots on the Sun. This finding was pivotal in showing that Earth's magnetic properties were influenced by solar activity.	Edward Sabine	England	earth-magnet, sunspot-cycle	Space	Research demonstrated that the frequency of disturbances in Earth's magnetic field paralleled the increase and decrease of sunspots. It established the first known connection between Earth and Sun involving something other than light, heat, or gravitational pull, indicating that sunspots had magnetic properties.		
elevators	1852	Elevators	The invention of the mechanical elevator with a safety guard revolutionized urban architecture by allowing buildings to rise to greater heights. This innovation enabled the construction of skyscrapers and transformed city landscapes.	Elisha Graves Otis	United States	reinforced-concrete	Design	Spearheading the creation of an elevator with an adequate safety guard, the device prevented the elevator from falling if its supporting cable severed. A public demonstration in 1854 showed the inventor safely ascending and descending after cutting the cable, proving the system's safety and functionality.		
age-of-the-sun	1853	Age of the sun	The Sun's energy source was identified as gravitational collapse rather than combustion, leading to the conclusion that the Sun is millions of years old and will eventually become too cool to support life on Earth. This challenged the belief that the Sun was eternal and suggested that Earth is much older than previously believed.	Hermann von Helmholtz	Germany	conservation-of-energy, biblical-age-of-earth	Space	It had been assumed for thousands of years that the Sun was eternal, unchanged, and only God could end it. The discovery of sunspots began to question this belief. With the law of conservation of energy established, scientists queried how the Sun could shine brilliantly for millions of years. Helmholtz proposed gravitational contraction as the energy source. This implied that the Sun had been gradually contracting for about twenty-five million years, and in another ten million years, it would be too small and cool to support life, indicating that the Earth is much older than twenty-five million years.		
glider	1853	Glider	Cayley created the first glider capable of sustaining flight through wind and updrafts. He forced his coachman take the first flight, flying 500 yards and surviving. This laid the foundation for the development of airplanes.	George Cayley	England	aerodynamics, hot-air-balloon	Science: Physics	Balloons existed for seventy years, showing that objects heavier than air could stay aloft under certain conditions. George Cayley scientifically studied these conditions, founding the science of aerodynamics. He discovered that fixed wings, like those on squirrels, were needed for flight, along with innovations in design including wings, tail, streamlined fuselage, and rudder. Realizing a suitable engine for powered flight wasn't yet available, he constructed a first glider in 1853, capable of gliding with wind and updrafts.		
kerosene	1853	Kerosene	A novel process to yield an inflammable liquid from asphalt became vital for lamps. It was crucial for illumination in Europe and America despite the challenge of producing sufficient quantities.	Abraham Gesner	Canada	gas-lighting	Science:Chemistry	In 1853 a British physician, Abraham Gesner, developed a process that would yield an inflammable liquid from asphalt. Because it was driven out of a waxy mixture of solid hydrocarbons, Gesner called the liquid kerosene, from a Greek word for 'wax.' Kerosene proved ideal for lamps, but even with Gesner’s process, enough kerosene could not be produced to meet the great demands represented by the lamps of Europe and America.		
cholera	1854	Cholera	Through studying a cholera epidemic, Snow identified contaminated water as the source of the Cholera disease, shaping future concepts of epidemiology and public health sanitation.	John Snow	England		Science:Medicine	In the early nineteenth century, Europe suffered from several cholera epidemics that arrived from India, where it was endemic. Increasingly, physicians were sure that the contagion arose from polluted water. An English physician, John Snow, had published his views on this matter in 1849. When an epidemic of cholera struck London in 1854, Snow studied the geographic incidence of cholera in relation to water supply. He found five hundred cases of cholera, for instance, within a few blocks of a public water pump that drew water from a well just a few feet from a sewer pipe. He had the pump handle removed, and		
telegraph-plateau	1854	Telegraph plateau	Laying cables across the Atlantic Ocean to connect Europe and America necessitated understanding the ocean floor. American oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury identified a central plateau, naming it the Telegraph Plateau, essential for cable laying.	Matthew Fontaine Maury	England	ocean-navigation, telegraph	Geography	With cables laid across the Hudson and Mississippi rivers in the 1840s and under the English Channel and the Irish Sea in the 1850s, it became natural to think of a real job, that of laying a cable under the Atlantic Ocean to connect Europe and America. The process of laying such a cable required some understanding of what the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was like, and the task fell to the American oceanographer Maury. In the early 1850s he had prepared a chart of ocean depths, and by 1854 he had noted that the Atlantic Ocean was shallower in the center than on either side. He concluded that there was a central plateau, which he called Telegraph Plateau.		
riemann-geometry	1854	Riemann geometry	Riemann generalized geometry to work with any number of dimensions, building on Lobachevsky and Bolay. He created self-consistent models where all lines intersect and all lines are finite in length, extending geometry's scope beyond traditional Euclidean limitations. 	Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann	Germany	non-euclidean-geometry	Math:Geometry	The non-Euclidean geometry worked out by Lobachevsky and Bolyai presupposed the possibility of more than one line through a point, all parallel to a given line that did not include the point. As in Euclidean geometry, lines of infinite length were possible. In 1854 a German mathematician, Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, developed another kind of non-Euclidean geometry, one in which it was impossible for any two lines to be parallel, and all lines intersected. In this geometry all lines were finite in length. In Euclidean geometry, the three angles of a triangle add up to 360 degrees; in Lobachevskian geometry, they add up to less than 360 degrees; and in Riemannian geometry, they add up to more than 360 degrees. Riemann's geometry is perfectly reasonable and self-consistent. He generalized geometry to the point where he considered it in any number of dimensions. He also considered situations in which measurements changed from point to point in space but in such a way that one could transform one set of measurements into another according to a fixed rule. At the time, this sounded like pure abstraction, but half a century later, Riemannian geometry was shown to represent a truer picture of the Universe than did Euclid's geometry, thanks to the theory of general relativity.		
lines-of-force	1855	Lines of force	Faraday introduced the concept of lines of force but knowing no math could only describe it pictorally. Maxwell translated it into mathematical form.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	electric-generators	Science:Physics	Faraday introduced the concept of lines of force, which he could only describe pictorially due to a lack of mathematical knowledge. In 1855, British mathematician James Clerk Maxwell managed to translate this concept into a mathematical form, demonstrating that Faraday's intuitive grasp of the subject was accurate.		
geissler-tubes	1855	Geissler tubes	The invention introduced improved vacuum tubes which led to advances in studying atomic structures. Utilizing mercury columns to create a superior vacuum, these tubes were more effectively evacuated compared to prior versions.	Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler	Germany	barometer	Science:Physics	Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler designed an air pump that did not require mechanical parts, using a mercury column to create a vacuum. These Geissler tubes were significantly more evacuated and transparent, aiding in future atomic structure studies.		
seismograph	1855	Seismograph	The first crude seismograph was invented to detect small tremors using horizontal tubes partly filled with mercury. Although not highly effective initially, it marked the beginning of earthquake monitoring equipment.	Luigi Palmieri	Italy	earthquakes, mercury-thermometer	Science:Geology	Luigi Palmieri invented the initial seismograph to detect minor earthquakes. It used horizontal tubes turned up at the ends and correctly filled with mercury; small iron floats would move with the tremors, allowing an estimate of their scale and intensity.		
pyroxylin	1855	Pyroxylin	A British chemist discovered that pyroxilin, if dissolved in alcohol, ether and camphor, would produce a hard solid upon evaporation. He found no practical application of this, but discovered the first synthetic plastic.	Alexander Parkes	England	cellulose	Science:Chemistry	Alexander Parkes discovered pyroxylin, a chemical compound that was instrumental in the development of new materials. This compound would later lead to the creation of celluloid, a precursor to modern plastics.		
glycogen	1856	Glycogen	Glycogen is a form of starch discovered in the mammalian liver that is easily broken down into glucose. This discovery showed that both plants and animals build up and break down complex molecules for energy storage and usage.	Claude Bernard	France	diabetes	Science:BiologyUntil now, starch had been viewed as the plant's way of storing energy. Animals tend to store it as fat (as some plants do too), which is a more compact form of energy. In 1856, however, the French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813–1878) discovered a form of starch in the mammalian liver. Because it was easily broken down to glucose (the immediate energy source in the bloodstream), he called it glycogen (Greek for 'glucose-producer'). He showed that glycogen was built up out of blood glucose and acted as a reserve store that could be broken down to glucose again when necessary. Whether glycogen was built up or broken down depended on the exact state of the body, the energy requirements of the various tissues, the food supply in the intestines, and so on. The net result was that the glycogen balance was so maneuvered that the sugar content in the blood remained steady. Until then, it was supposed that plants built up complex molecules (anabolism) and that animals tore them down (catabolism). Bernard's work showed that animals built up complex molecules as well, and as time went on, it appeared that both plants and animals built up and broke down substances as needed. What was different between them was that the build-up in plants was through solar energy, while in animals, the build-up was through chemical energy from food, the food being obtained eventually if not directly, from plants.			
bessemer-steel	1856	Bessemer steel	A new steel making process allowed for the removal of excess carbon in cast iron, creating tough, hard steel more cheaply. This innovation paved the way for the construction of infrastructure such as buildings and elevators in the next century.	Henry Bessemer	England	coke-iron, oxygen	Science:Metallurgy	The Bessemer process involves burning off carbon from cast iron more cheaply by using a blast of air through molten iron. By optimizing the combination of oxygen from the air and carbon in the iron, this method allowed for the economical production of durable steel, which was essential for building the cities of the future.		
synthetic-dyes	1856	Synthetic dyes	Attempting to synthesize quinine, an accidental creation of synthetic dyes revolutionized the textile industry by providing a wide array of colors that were previously difficult to achieve. 	William Henry Perkin	England	dye, quinine	Science:Chemistry	William Henry Perkin accidentally discovered mauve dye while attempting to synthesize quinine. This innovation led him to establish a dye manufacturing industry, which met great commercial success and transformed the world of fashion with synthetic colors.		
neanderthal-man	1856	Neanderthal man	The discovery of Neanderthal bones in Neander Valley in Germany provided key insights into human evolution. This finding helped establish the understanding that humans have ancient origins and are part of a long lineage.	Pierre-Paul Broca	France	biblical-age-of-earth	Science:Archaeology	In Neander Valley, Germany, workers found ancient bones, including a skull, which were identified by a professor at a nearby school. This significant discovery contributed to the fields of geology and biology, confirming the ancient age of Earth and early human ancestors.		
pasteurization	1856	Pasteurization	Pasteurization is a process that heats liquids to a specific temperature to kill harmful microorganisms, preventing spoilage and disease. It revolutionized the wine industry and later the dairy industry by making products safer for consumption.	Louis Pasteur	France	fermentation, bacteria	Science:Microbiology	French wine was turning sour as it aged, causing significant losses. Through his research, Pasteur found that wine contained different types of yeast cells, and by heating the wine to about 50°C, he could kill the yeast cells without affecting the wine's taste. This method, called pasteurization, was eventually applied to milk to prevent the spread of diseases caused by contaminated dairy products. It had a significant impact on food safety and led to further advancements in microbiology.		
saturns-rings-composition	1857	Saturn's rings composition	Saturn's rings were hypothesized to be composed of myriad small particles. Maxwell confirmed this using Roche's limit, solidifying the theory.	James Clerk Maxwell	Scotland	roche-limit	Space	By this time, it seemed very likely that Saturn's rings were composed of myriads of small particles. Since they were inside Roche's limit, solid particles would break up under tidal influences and be unable to coalesce again. In 1857, Maxwell showed that this was indeed so, based on purely theoretical considerations, and no one has doubted it since.		
evolution-by-natural-selection	1858	Evolution by natural selection	Natural selection explained how some species evolve into other related species while others become extinct, driven by the competition for survival. This theory posited that nature selects the fittest individuals to survive and pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring.	Charles Robert Darwin	England	population-growth-theory	Science:Biology	The British biologist Charles Robert Darwin believed that life forms had evolved; that some species, with time, changed into other related species, while some species became extinct. Darwin theorized that not only human beings multiplied past the food supply available, but that all living things did. Therefore, in each generation, there was a competition for survival among the too-many, and those tended to survive who could snatch enough food, or best evade a predator. In short, nature itself would select a few from the many for survival. The characteristics that made survival likely would be inherited by the offspring of the survivors and again there would be a natural selection. Darwin assumed that there were always variations among offspring, random and tiny variations perhaps, and that nature then used those variations as a means of selection, so to speak. The 'better' among the variations would not always do better, since there was always the factor of chance, but on the whole, and in the long run, they would.		
organic-molecular-structure	1858	Organic molecular structure	A major advancement in understanding molecular structure, highlighting the arrangement of atoms within compounds using the concept of valence. This system introduced notation: Water would be H—O—H, and carbon dioxide O=C=O, clarifying the organization of organic molecules, resolving many mysteries of organic chemistry.	August Kekulé	Germany	valence-theory	Science:Chemistry	Until this point, organic molecules were characterized solely by the number of atoms of each element present. Even with isomers showing identical atom counts but different properties, it was unclear how to distinguish these differences. Friedrich August Kekulé expanded on Frankland's idea of valence, illustrating how each hydrogen atom could bond to others and how atoms within molecules can form complex structures by latching onto valence bonds. This led to the clarification of organic molecules' structures and the resolution of many mysteries in organic chemistry.		
cellular-pathology	1858	Cellular pathology	Further development of cell theory, emphasizing the importance of cells in pathology. This advancement strengthened the concept that all diseases involve changes at the cellular level, and opposed the idea of spontaneous generation.	Rudolph Virchow	Germany	cell-theory, pathology, no-spontaneous-generation-redux	Science:Biology	Building on the cell theory, which emerged in 1838, Rudolph Virchow continued to refine our understanding of pathology by stressing that all diseases are manifestations of changes in cells. This insight provided a crucial framework for modern medical practices, making it possible to relate clinical symptoms and pathological findings to cellular alterations.		
refrigerators	1858	Refrigerators	Refrigerators are devices that lower temperatures to keep food from spoiling by using the principle of evaporative cooling. They evolved from bulky and inconvenient devices into almost universal household appliances over approximately seventy-five years.	Ferdinand Carré	France	liquefying-gases	General	Reducing food to a low temperature kept it from spoiling, and in early times, natural ice was used for the purpose. In the early nineteenth century, mechanical refrigerators were developed by liquefying gases to lower temperature and condensing them to pump out heat. Ferdinand Carré designed the first successful commercial refrigerator in 1858 using water; he switched to ammonia in 1859 which was more efficient. Though initially used industrially for ice-making and meat-packing, they eventually became convenient for household use after extensive improvements.		
electricity-in-a-vacuum	1858	Electricity in a vacuum	The study of electricity in a vacuum involves observing electric currents in evacuated vessels, leading to the discovery of fluorescence in a Geissler tube. This phenomenon, characterized by a greenish glow, resulted from the energetic collision of radiation with matter.	Julius Plücker	Germany	geissler-tubes, electrical-motion	Science:Physics	Occasionally, scientists attempted to force an electric current through a vacuum to study the electric fluid without interference. The phenomenon of fluorescence was first observed by Gabriel Stokes when an electric current was passed through vacuum-enclosed glass vessels. In 1858, Julius Plücker forced an electric current through a Geissler tube and observed the glowing fluorescence, which shifted due to an electromagnetic field. This discovery helped further the understanding of vacuums and electric currents.		
oil-wells	1859	Oil wells	This invention marked the first instance of drilling for oil, which was sometimes found on the surface, leading to the mass production of kerosene and other petroleum products. It utilized a method previously applied to brine drilling, significantly boosting oil availability and impacting various industries.	Edwin Laurentine Drake	United States	kerosene, oil-lamp	Science:Geology	Petroleum, a complex mixture of hydrocarbons from microorganisms' fat content, was previously extracted from the surface. It was discovered that drilling could access deeper, untapped reserves. Edwin Laurentine Drake utilized a method from brine drilling and drilled the first successful oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. This discovery led to the mass production of kerosene and spurred further oil drilling.		
storage-battery	1859	Storage battery	A reversible chemical reaction allowed rechargeable batteries to store electric current after being depleted. This invention provided a way to repeatedly charge and use batteries for electric power storage, paving the path for more efficient energy usage and storage solutions.	Gaston Planté	France	electric-battery	Science:Physics	All the electric batteries used in the six decades since Volta had invented the first one were one-shot affairs. The chemical reaction that gave rise to the electric current eventually proceeded to a point where it could no longer support current. It then had to be discarded, for the chemical reaction could not be reversed. Yet some chemical reactions are easily reversible. In 1859, a French physicist, Gaston Planté (1834-1889), took two sheets of lead, with an insulating sheet of rubber between them, rolled the lead sheets into a spiral, and upended it into dilute sulfuric acid. He found that a chemical reaction resulted that would produce an electric current. Furthermore, when the battery was discharged, an electric current could be forced through it in the opposite direction, and the chemical reaction would be reversed, so that the battery could eventually produce an electric current again. Naturally, we are not getting something for nothing. The second law of thermodynamics (see 1850) would not allow that. The electrical energy required to charge a storage battery is always greater than the amount it can then deliver. It would be a losing proposition, therefore, to charge a discharged storage battery from one that was fully charged. To charge a storage battery, you must get your electricity from a generator that makes use of fuel energy or some other nonelectrical source of energy.		
spectral-lines-and-elements	1859	Spectral lines and elements	Since their discovery by Fraunhofer nearly half a century before, spectral lines had not been connected with chemistry. The discovery that each element produces characteristic spectral lines when heated extended knowledge about chemical elements and their behaviors. This finding allowed for the identification of elements through their unique spectral fingerprints.	Gustav Robert Kirchhoff	Germany	spectral-lines	Science:Chemistry	Since their discovery by Fraunhofer nearly half a century before, spectral lines had not been connected with chemistry. The German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), however, had carefully studied the spectra of light produced when various elements were heated to incandescence. He found that each element produced light of only certain wavelengths, so that the spectrum consisted sometimes of only a few lines of light, which were sometimes well separated. In 1859 Kirchhoff announced that every element produced characteristic spectral lines, which it also absorbed when its vapors were cooler than the light source. The pattern of lines was different for each element; no two elements shared spectral lines in exactly the same positions. In essence, each element had a spectral 'fingerprint.' This meant that if any sample of ore, on being heated to incandescence, produced even a single spectral line in a position not recorded for any known element, then some new element must be present in that ore. Making use of such spectroscopic data, Kirchhoff discovered cesium in 1860. The name is derived from the Latin word for 'sky-blue,' since that was the color of the spectral line that had given away cesium's existence. The next year Kirchhoff discovered rubidium, a related element, its name coming from the Latin for 'red.' Kirchhoff also pointed out that the dark lines in the solar spectrum were the result of light being absorbed by the gases in the sun.		
solar-flares	1859	Solar flares	An astronomical observation identified solar flares, which are brief but violent explosions associated with sunspots. This discovery enhanced understanding of the Sun's activity, distinguishing between periods of high and low sunspot activity.	Richard Christopher Carrington	England	sunspot-cycle	Space	The British astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington observed the Sun's rotation by measuring sunspots. He noticed a bright point of light that lasted for five minutes and then subsided, which he initially speculated to be a falling meteor but later realized was a solar flare. This observation linked sunspots with solar flares and marked the understanding of 'active' and 'quiet' phases of the Sun based on sunspot activity.		
kinetic-theory-of-gases	1859	Kinetic theory of gases	Maxwell described the behavior of gases based on the movement and velocity distribution of their molecules. It provided a statistical approach to understanding how gas molecules behave differently depending on temperature and velocity, revolutionizing thermodynamics.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	boyles-law, thermochemistry, charles-law	Science:Physics	James Clerk Maxwell worked on mathematical relationships describing how the molecules of a gas move randomly at different speeds and bounce off walls with perfect elasticity. He discovered that the distribution of molecular velocities could be linked to the temperature and that gases can exhibit statistically significant deviations from expected behavior. This indicated that gases could sometimes defy the second law of thermodynamics, challenging existing theories.		
spontaneous-generation-rip	1860	Spontaneous generation R. I. P.	Pasteur's experiment conclusively demonstrated that life does not spontaneously arise from non-living matter. This was the nail in the coffin for the concept of spontaneous generation.	Louis Pasteur	France	no-spontaneous-generation-redux	Science:BiologyPasteur boiled meat extract and placed it in a flask with a long, curved neck that allowed air to enter but prevented dust particles from falling in. The meat extract did not spoil or develop microorganisms, disproving the theory of spontaneous generation and suggesting that dust carries microorganisms.			
internal-combustion-engine	1860	Internal-combustion engine	Instead of using steam to move a piston, what if flammable vapor and air could explode within a cylinder to move the piston instead? Although still too inefficient to be practical, this engine powered small vehicles and represented a significant step in the evolution of modern transportation.	Jean-Joseph-Étienne Lenoir	France	kinetic-theory-of-gases, steam-engine-efficiency	Design	Prior to the internal-combustion engine, steam engines were the primary source of mechanical power. Lenoir's invention harnessed the explosive force of flammable vapor mixed with air within a cylinder to move a piston directly. This compact and responsive engine was the precursor to the efficient internal-combustion engines that came thereafter, enabling the creation of horseless carriages and ultimately revolutionizing transportation.		
organic-synthesis	1860	Organic synthesis	Berthelot was able to synthesize organic molecules in a lab without the use of living matter. This advancement supported the development of organic chemistry and debunked the idea that only living tissue could manufacture complex organic molecules.	Pierre-Eugène-Marcelin Berthelot	France	synthetic-urea	Science: Chemistry	When Wöhler synthesized urea, it challenged the notion that complex organic molecules could only be produced by living organisms. Pierre-Eugène-Marcelin Berthelot furthered this field by synthesizing important organic compounds such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, methane, benzene, and acetylene by 1860. This led to the realization that the chemical structures and properties of organic molecules could be replicated outside of living systems, aiding the progression of organic chemistry.		
solar-prominences	1860	Solar prominences	Advancements in astronomical photography allowed for the detailed capture of solar phenomena. This included solar prominences which are gouts of flame around the edge of the sun during a total eclipse. This was the first astronomical discovery made as a result of photography, and required de la Rue to quickly travel to Spain.	Warren de la Rue	England	reflecting-telescope, photography, solar-flares, steam-locomotive-improved	Space	Through the use of a specially adapted telescope, the English astronomer Warren de la Rue excelled in photographing the Sun's phenomena. In 1860 during a trip to Spain, he captured an image of a total solar eclipse that clearly showed flame-like prominences extending from the sun. These images provided valuable insights into solar behavior and greatly improved the understanding of solar prominences.		
avogadro-revived	1860	Avogadro's hypothesis revived	Avogadro's hypothesis, revived by Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro, clarified that the molecular weight of gases can be determined with certainty, resolving much confusion in molecular structure.	Stanislao Cannizzaro	Italy	avogadro-hypothesis, organic-molecular-structure	Science:Chemistry	Avogadro's hypothesis, revived by Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro, clarified that the molecular weight of gases can be determined, resolving much confusion in molecular structure. Presented at an international conference of chemists in Karlsruhe, it gained acceptance and led to a general agreement over molecular structures.		
black-bodies	1860	Blackbody Radiation	The theory of black bodies, suggested by Kirchhoff, posits that a body absorbing all light and reflecting none, known as a black body, when heated, emits all wavelengths of light. This led to significant advancements in understanding light and temperature distribution across the spectrum.	Gustav Robert Kirchhoff	Germany	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Physics	The theory of black bodies, suggested by Kirchhoff, posits that a body absorbing all light and reflecting none, known as a black body, when heated, emits all wavelengths of light. This theory was a crucial advancement in physics, aiding the understanding of light wavelength emission and temperature distribution across the total spectrum, eventually leading to a major revolution in physics.		
archeopteryx	1861	Archeopteryx	Archeopteryx is a fossil representing an ancient life form that lies between dinosaurs and birds, showing evolutionary transition. It showcases a blend of lizard-like and avian features, highlighting the link between the two groups.	Hermann von Meyer	Germany	iguanodon, evolution-by-natural-selection	Science:Biology	Although the giant dinosaurs, whose fossil relics had been dug up over the past forty years, were the most dramatic remnants of ancient life, the most important single fossil was not a giant, but a relatively small lizardlike animal that was discovered in 1861. It left a clear impression in a rock, which showed that it had a head possessing teeth and a beak, a long neck, a long tail, and a flat breastbone—all very lizardlike. There was, however, one all-important added feature. The 'lizard' had feathers. The imprints of those feathers are unmistakable. They are in a double row down the length of the tail and are also present along the forelimbs.		
brocas-area	1861	Broca's area	Gall had speculated that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body. Now a postmortem of Broca's patient who lost the ability to speak revealed damage to an area in the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum.	Pierre-Paul Broca	France	phrenology	Science:Biology	Gall had been of the opinion that different parts of the brain controlled different parts and functions of the body. Gall’s conclusions were strictly speculative. Broca, the first person to present conclusive evidence of a specific region of the brain in charge of a specific function, had a fifty-one-year-old patient who had lost the ability to speak. When the patient died in 1861, a postmortem revealed damage to the third convolution on the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum (now known as Broca’s convolution). Gall’s insight, which had been misdirected into phrenology, was thus put right.		
thallium	1861	Thallium	Thallium was discovered through spectroscopy, distinguishing itself with a bright green spectral line. This element, derived from heated selenium ores, was significant for its unique identifying characteristic via spectroscopy.	William Crookes	England	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Chemistry	Kirchhoff was not the only one to discover new elements by means of spectroscopy. The British physicist William Crookes was working with selenium ores, and in 1861 he came upon a sample of such ore that when heated showed a bright green line characteristic of no known element. He analyzed the ore in search of the new element, found it, and named it thallium, from the Greek word for 'green twig' after the color of its line.		
germ-theory-of-disease	1862	Germ theory of disease	Pasteur surveyed the evidence and synthesized it into a theory that contagious diseases are caused by microorganisms. It revolutionized medicine, leading to the prevention and treatment of diseases and significantly increasing life expectancy.	Louis Pasteur	France	pasteurization, cholera	Science:Biology	In 1862, Pasteur took up the matter and issued a publication that gathered all the evidence supporting that microorganisms cause diseases. This became a pivotal advancement in medicine, reducing the death rate, doubling life expectancy, and contributing to a significant population growth. The theory allowed scientists to identify specific microorganisms responsible for diseases and develop ways to prevent or cure them.		
dim-companion-of-sirius	1862	Dim companion of sirius	Using a newly ground 18-inch lens, Clark saw an anomaly near Sirius. The existence of a dark companion star orbiting Sirius was confirmed through its gravitational influence. This discovery added to the understanding of binary star systems.	Alvan Graham Clark	United States	companion-of-sirius	Space	Bessel had suggested the existence of a dark companion of Sirius, one that could not be seen but whose existence was indicated by its gravitational influence. On January 31, 1862, American astronomer Alvan Graham Clark confirmed this by observing the companion star through a telescope.		
hydrogen-in-the-sun	1862	Hydrogen in the sun	In later years, astronomers began to use spectral lines to compare the position of the dark lines to determine the solar spectrum. Ångström discovered hydrogen in the Sun, and later published a spectrum with wavelengths represented by each line in units of ten-billionths of a meter, now known as the ångström.	Anders Jonas Ångström	Sweden	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Physics	In 1862, the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Ångström announced his discovery of hydrogen in the Sun. He went on, in later years, to publish a map of the spectrum that showed the position of the dark lines in comparison to the solar spectrum, measured in units that are still known today as the ångström.		
chloroplasts	1862	Chloroplasts	Rather than being uniformly spread through plant cells, chlorophyll is concentrated in discrete bodies named chloroplasts. Starch grains appeared within chloroplasts, supporting the product of photosynthesis.	Julius von Sachs	Germany	chlorophyll-and-cells	Science:Biology	In 1862, the German botanist Julius von Sachs observed that plant cells contained discrete chlorophyll bodies, which he called chloroplasts. He noted that starch grains appeared within these chloroplasts, linking them directly to photosynthesis.		
source-of-the-white-nile	1862	Source of the white nile	Confirmed that the stream flowing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the White Nile. Speke traced the longest river flowing into Lake Victoria, the Luvironza, establishing it as the true source of the Nile, located in modern-day Burundi.	Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke	England	nile-river	Geography	In 1862, explorations led by Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke confirmed that a stream issuing from the northern rim of Lake Victoria was the White Nile. Speke traced the longest inflowing river, the Luvironza, establishing it as the true source of the Nile, located in modern-day Burundi.		
ironclad-warships	1862	Ironclad warships	The Confederate ironclad warship Merrimack (later renamed Virginia) attacked and sank wooden Union ships with ease due to its iron armor. The Union responded with its own ironclad, Monitor, and after a five-hour indecisive battle, it became clear that wooden warships were outdated, leading navies worldwide to adopt ironclads.	John Ericsson	United States	bessemer-steel, transatlantic-liner	War	The ironclad warship Merrimack (later renamed Virginia) attacked and sank wooden Union ships with ease due to its iron armor. The Union responded with its own ironclad, Monitor, and after a five-hour indecisive battle, it became clear that wooden warships were outdated, leading navies worldwide to adopt ironclads.		
machine-guns	1862	Machine guns	The Gatling gun, the first machine gun, was invented to shoot multiple bullets in rapid succession, building on repeating rifles called carbines which had come into use in 1860. It greatly increased the firepower available to armed forces, making it a significant development in military technology.	Richard Jordan Gatling	United States	revolvers	War	American inventor Richard Jordan Gatling created a rapid-fire gun that could shoot nearly six bullets per second using a rotating barrel mechanism. This invention, known as the Gatling gun, was used by Union forces during the Civil War and represented a major advancement in repeating firearms.		
hemoglobin	1862	Hemoglobin	The protein hemoglobin, crucial in carrying oxygen in the blood, was identified and named. This discovery was fundamental in understanding blood's role in oxygen transportation.	Felix Hoppe-Seyler	Germany	protein, oxygen	Science:Biology	German biochemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler crystallized the protein hemoglobin, which combines with oxygen in the lungs and transports it to tissues. He gave it the name hemoglobin (derived from the Greek word for blood, hemo, and globin, a protein class), and discovered that hemoglobin becomes oxyhemoglobin when it binds with oxygen.		
greenhouse-effect	1863	Greenhouse effect	The concept describes how gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in surface temperatures. This phenomenon is similar to how a greenhouse works.	John Tyndall	England	infrared-radiation	Science:Physics	In 1863, the Irish physicist John Tyndall pointed out that gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor are transparent to the visible light that reaches Earth's surface from the Sun, but rather opaque to the infrared radiations that the Earth gives off to space when it cools down at night. This means that the presence of even a small amount of these gases in the air will keep the Earth's surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be. This resembles the situation in a greenhouse, where light enters through the glass and warms the atmosphere within, but heat escapes only with difficulty, so that the net effect is to warm the greenhouse. For this reason, the action of carbon dioxide and water vapor is referred to as the greenhouse effect. Since human activity has somewhat increased the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and is continuing to do so, the greenhouse effect has become a serious threat.		
law-of-octaves	1863	Law of octaves	Now that over sixty elements were known, the proposed Law of Octaves grouped elements based on their atomic weights in a repeating pattern, resembling musical octaves. This failed attempt helped pave the way for better-organized periodic tables.	John Alexander Reina Newlands	England		Science:Chemistry	By this time, over sixty elements were known, and they seemed to represent an unruly jungle of characteristics. Chemists were uneasy with that, so they tried to group elements into families. Several attempts had already been made, but an English chemist tried something a bit different. He listed the elements in order of atomic weight and found that the second seven repeated the properties of the first seven quite closely. He tried to extend this further, referring to it as the law of octaves (as in music, where the same seven notes are repeated over and over, with every eighth note resembling the first octave higher, octave coming from the Latin word for “eight”). Newlands's work was not taken seriously because the list of elements fit the law of octaves very imperfectly. Nevertheless, it helped put the listing of elements in vogue, and in the course of the following decade, a much superior table was established.		
constitution-of-the-stars	1863	Constitution of the stars	Spectral analysis of stars revealed that their composition was similar to elements found on Earth, suggesting a commonality in the universe's materials. This discovery supported the idea that the universe comprises the same elements throughout.	William Huggins	England	spectral-lines-and-elements	Space	Granted that the elements in the Sun seemed to be the same as those on Earth, might it be argued that the Solar System would naturally be made of one set of materials but that other stars might be made of other elements? The English astronomer William Huggins studied the spectra of some of the brighter stars and announced in 1863 that their spectral lines were those of the old familiar elements. Presumably, then, the entire Universe was made up of the same elements.		
barbiturates	1863	Barbiturates	The discovery of barbituric acid led to the development of barbiturates, a class of compounds significant in the formulation of sleeping pills. This medicinal discovery has had a lasting impact on pharmacology.	Adolf von Baeyer	Germany	acid-base	Science:Pharmacology	In 1863 the German chemist Adolf von Baeyer discovered barbituric acid. Barbituric acid is the parent substance of a family of compounds known as barbiturates, which are well known today for their use in sleeping pills.		
indium	1863	Indium	Indium was discovered through spectroscopic analysis of a zinc ore precipitate, revealing a new element with unique indigo spectral lines. 	Ferdinand Reich and Theodor Richter	Germany	spectral-lines-and-elements	Science:Chemistry	A German mineralogist suspected that a yellow precipitate he had obtained from a zinc ore might contain a new metal. Because he himself was color-blind, he had his assistant examine it spectroscopically. Richer did so and spotted an indigo-colored line that was not characteristic of any known element. The new element was therefore named indium.		
nature-of-orion-nebula	1864	Nature of Orion Nebula	The Orion Nebula, previously thought to be a simple cloud of gas, was discovered to contain clusters of faint stars. This finding indicated that stars are embedded in nebulous regions and contribute to the nebula's luminosity.	William Huggins	England	clusters-and-nebulas	Space	Some patches of nebulosity, including the Milky Way itself, had turned out to be clusters of faint stars. A number of Messier objects had turned out to be globular clusters. The Orion nebula was studied, and it was found that its spectrum was typical of what would be expected of a luminous gas. It was concluded that the nebula is a large cloud of gas with stars embedded in it, which heat the gas to luminosity.		
genetics	1865	Genetics	Mendel discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance by conducting experiments with pea plants. He observed how plant height was passed from one generation to the next. Dominant traits would overpower recessive ones, but the recessive traits could reappear in future generations.	Gregor Johann Mendel	Austria	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science: Biology	Gregor Mendel, an Austrian botanist and monk, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance by conducting experiments with pea plants. He observed how certain traits, like plant height, were passed from one generation to the next. By carefully arranging plants to self-pollinate and analyzing the traits in their offspring, Mendel concluded that organisms have pairs of factors for each trait that segregate during reproduction. Dominant traits would overpower recessive ones, but the recessive traits could reappear in future generations. His work laid the groundwork for the science of genetics.		
benzene-ring	1865	Benzene ring	The benzene ring is a molecular structure consisting of six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring with hydrogen atoms attached. This configuration made benzene stable and significantly contributed to the understanding of molecular structures.	August Kekulé	Germany	organic-molecular-structure	Science:Chemistry	The molecule of benzene is made up of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. Given a chain of six carbon atoms, there seemed to be no way of adding six hydrogen atoms without producing a very unstable compound—and benzene was quite stable. It was Kekulé himself who found the answer in 1865. According to his own story, he was in a semidoze in a horse-drawn bus and was visualizing carbon chains when suddenly the tail end of one chain attached itself to the head end and formed a spinning ring. At once he saw that if he imagined the six carbon atoms forming a hexagonal ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon, a stable atom might be the result. Once the notion of carbon rings was added to that of carbon chains, many structural problems were solved.		
avogadros-number	1865	Avogadro’s number	Avogadro’s number represents the number of molecules in 22.4 liters of any gas, which is approximately 6×10^23. This measurement allowed scientists to quantify the number of atoms and molecules in a given volume and weigh gases accurately.	Johann Joseph Loschmidt	England	kinetic-theory-of-gases, avogadro-revived	Science:Chemistry	The hydrogen molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atom has an atomic weight of just about 1, so that a hydrogen molecule has a molecular weight of 2. Hydrogen gas is made up of hydrogen molecules, and at 0°C and normal atmospheric pressure at sea level, 22.4 liters (5.9 gallons) of hydrogen gas weigh 2 grams. This is the molecular weight in grams, or 1 mole. Since equal volumes of gases are made up of equal numbers of molecules, according to Avogadro’s hypothesis (see 1811), and since each oxygen molecule has a weight of 32, then 22.4 liters of oxygen gas would weigh 32 grams—or 1 mole. In fact, 22.4 liters of any gas are likely to weigh 1 mole. The question is, how many molecules are there in 22.4 liters of a gas? In 1865 the Austrian chemist Johann Joseph Loschmidt used Maxwell’s kinetic theory of gases (see 1859) to calculate what that number ought to be. It turned out to be about 600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or six hundred billion trillion. Since all this was based on Avogadro’s hypothesis, the number was called Avogadro’s number. From Avogadro’s number, you could calculate the actual mass of a hydrogen molecule, since it would be 2 grams divided by six hundred billion trillion. A hydrogen atom would have a mass half that, and the mass of other atoms and molecules could be calculated as well. For the first time, scientists had a notion, and a rather good one, as it turned out, of the mass of the tiny atoms and molecules that make up matter.		
antiseptic-surgery	1865	Antiseptic surgery	Lister introduced the use of phenol solutions to clean hands and instruments during surgeries, which significantly reduced post-operative infections. This advancement drastically reduced the mortality rates and complications associated with surgeries.	Joseph Lister	England	anesthesia, germ-theory-of-disease, puerperal-fever	Science:Medicine	Anesthetics had come into use nearly twenty years before, but if the process had become more...		
maxwells-equations	1865	Maxwell’s equations	Maxwell devised a set of equations that unified electricity and magnetism into a single electromagnetic force. These equations demonstrated the relationship between electric oscillations and electromagnetic fields, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave.	James Clerk Maxwell	England	laws-motion	Science:Physics	The culminating work of Maxwell came when he began to devise a set of equations, simple in form, that expressed all the varied phenomena of electricity and magnetism and bound them together indissolubly, as Newton had done for gravitation. Maxwell showed that electricity and magnetism did not exist separately, but that each was an inevitable aspect of the other. There was a single electromagnetic force. Maxwell showed that the oscillation of an electric charge produced an electromagnetic field that radiated outward from its source at a constant speed. This speed could be calculated from the equations and turned out to be just the speed of light.		
mobius-strip	1865	Möbius strip	The Möbius strip is a one-sided surface that challenges traditional geometry, created by twisting a strip of paper 180 degrees and joining its ends. This concept found applications in various scientific and artistic fields, demonstrating properties of non-orientable surfaces and founding topology.	August Ferdinand Möbius	Germany	analytic-geometry	Math:Topology	In 1865, the German mathematician August Ferdinand Möbius presented what came to be called a Möbius strip. This is a long, flat strip of paper (or other flexible material) that is given a half twist and the two ends then pasted together to give a circular figure with one edge and one side. The resulting construction has only one surface and one edge. This made Möbius one of the founders of topology, the branch of mathematics that deals with properties of figures that are not altered by deformations (as long as there is no tearing).		
cylinder-locks	1865	Cylinder locks	Cylinder locks feature a key with a serrated edge that aligns spring-loaded pins within the lock cylinder to allow entry. This innovation significantly increased security for locks by making them difficult to pick and easy to mass-produce with unique key combinations.	Linus Yale	United States		Design	In 1865, an American locksmith patented a cylinder lock with tumblers that had to be brought into a certain alignment for the lock to open. The key had a serrated edge that sufficed to bring the tumblers into line. A vast number of combinations were possible, so that every key could be unique, even if there were millions of locks. The familiar locks and keys that have controlled house and apartment doors ever since are based on this principle.		
dynamite	1866	Dynamite	Dynamite is a powerful explosive material composed by safely combining nitroglycerine with kieselguhr. It allowed safe, controlled explosions for construction and mining, revolutionizing those industries.	Alfred Bernard Nobel	Sweden	nitroglycerine	Science: Chemistry	During the twenty years since nitroglycerine had been discovered, it had been used in blasting roads through mountains, digging canals, and laying foundations. However, it was highly unstable, and frequently caused accidental explosions. Swedish inventor Alfred Bernard Nobel developed a safer way of using nitroglycerine by combining it with kieselguhr, a substance that absorbed the liquid nitroglycerine without detonating. This combination, called dynamite, could be handled safely until an external detonator was used, making it ideal for controlled explosions in construction and mining. This invention significantly improved safety in these industries and led to the establishment of the annual Nobel prizes funded by Nobel's estate.		
clinical-thermometer	1866	Clinical thermometer	The clinical thermometer is a medical instrument designed to accurately measure a patient's body temperature. It made temperature measurement more convenient and reliable in clinical settings.	Thomas Clifford Allbutt	England	mercury-thermometer	Science: Medicine	Doctors had long recognized the importance of knowing a patient’s temperature, but existing thermometers were cumbersome, imprecise, and slow, often requiring up to 20 minutes to register results. British physician Thomas Clifford Allbutt developed a small thermometer that could be easily used to measure body temperature more quickly and accurately. This invention greatly improved clinical diagnostics and patient care, allowing for more efficient and precise monitoring of patient health.		
kirkwood-gaps	1866	Kirkwood gaps	The discovery of the Kirkwood gaps revealed that the distribution of asteroids in the asteroid belt is not uniform. These gaps occur due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter, which causes asteroids to be either pulled away or pushed into these gaps.	Daniel Kirkwood	United States	asteroids	Space	By now, nearly ninety asteroids had been discovered and their orbits calculated. It was clear that they were not evenly distributed, and the American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood showed in 1866 that there were definite gaps, since called 'Kirkwood gaps.' He explained these gaps by postulating that any asteroids that would have been in those gaps would revolve around the Sun in a period that had a simple ratio to the period of Jupiter. That meant that every two or three turns of the asteroid would bring it into the same position with respect to Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational pull would then be cumulative, and the asteroid would be forced either farther from the Sun or nearer to it, leaving a gap.		
earths-iron-core	1866	Earth's iron core	The hypothesis that Earth's center must be composed of denser material than its crust was confirmed through the study of meteorites. This led to the acceptance that Earth has a nickel-iron core, shaping our understanding of the planet's composition.	Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée	France	mass-of-the-earth, meteorites	Science:Geology	Ever since Cavendish had determined the Earth's mass (see 1798), it had been known that the Earth's average density was about twice that of its rocky crust. The conclusion was that Earth's center must be made of material that was denser than rock. Metal seemed to be the only reasonable alternative. The French geologist Gabriel-Auguste Daubrée, considering the fact that a number of meteorites were composed of a nickel-iron alloy (though most were rocky), assumed that if meteorites were remnants of an exploded planet, the rocky ones came from the outermost portions of the planet, and the nickel-iron ones came from its core. He reasoned that this would be true of Earth as well, so that Earth had a nickel-iron core. This has been accepted by geologists ever since.		
composition-of-a-nova	1866	Composition of a nova	The study of nova spectra revealed that they are dominated by hydrogen, indicating its presence as a major component of the Universe. This finding was pivotal in understanding the composition and behavior of novas.	William Huggins	England	supernova, reflecting-telescope	Space	Since the exceedingly bright novas spied by Tycho Brahe and by Kepler nearly three centuries before, further novas of the sort had been seen. Nevertheless, dim novas had been sighted, and they still attracted notice because they had brightened suddenly and without warning. In 1866 Huggins managed to study the spectrum of a nova and showed from its spectral lines that it was surrounded by a cloud of hydrogen. This was the first indication that hydrogen might be a dominating constituent of the Universe.		
dry-cell	1867	Dry cell	Up to now, all batteries were made of liquids inside a container, which was not safe. The dry cell battery was invented, which converted battery fluid into a non-spillable paste. This innovation made batteries safer and more practical for everyday use.	Georges Leclanché	France	storage-battery	Science:Chemistry	Batteries before this consisted of liquid-filled containers that required careful handling. In 1867, Georges Leclanché created a cell that converted the liquid into a stiff paste, making it much safer and easier to use. The resulting dry cells enabled the widespread use of batteries in various small devices, from flashlights to toys.		
typewriters	1867	Typewriters	The first typewriter that could be used to write as quickly as hand writing was invented, streamlining the process of document creation. This invention marked a significant advancement in writing technology.	Christopher Latham Sholes	United States	printing-press	Design:Technology	Printing had existed for centuries but writing letters or stories still had to be done by hand. Attempts to create machines for this purpose existed, but they were cumbersome and slow. In 1867, Christopher Latham Sholes invented the first reasonably compact and practical writing machine, which could produce documents more quickly than manual handwriting.		
law-of-mass-action	1867	Law of mass action	The law of mass action describes how chemical reactions can be reversed by varying the mass of the reactants. This principle has been fundamental in advancing the field of thermodynamics and chemical reaction engineering.	Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage	Norway	thermochemistry	Science:Chemistry	Chemists discovered that chemical reactions could often proceed in two directions, and by increasing the mass of one set of reactants, the reaction could be forced to move in the direction that consumed that set. Norwegian chemists Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage demonstrated that it's not mass alone but concentration—the quantity of mass in a given volume—that determines reaction direction. Known as the law of mass action, it was promulgated in 1867 and laid the foundation for modern thermodynamics and its application to chemical reactions.		
air-brake	1868	Air brake	The air brake uses compressed air to simultaneously stop every wheel on a train, greatly improving rail safety. This invention overcame the difficulty of manually stopping trains, which involved significant risks of collisions and accidents.	George Westinghouse	United States	steam-locomotive-improved	Design: Engineering	In 1868 the American engineer George Westinghouse invented the air brake, which used compressed air rather than human muscle. Such an air brake could be applied simultaneously to every wheel on the train. Cornelius Vanderbilt dismissed the idea as a 'fool notion' because he did not believe that one could stop a train by the use of air. However, the air brake, after some improvements, caught on quickly and greatly increased rail safety.		
helium	1868	Helium	Thanks to modern transportation, astronomers could take a journey to see an eclipse if they liked. Studying an eclipse in India, Janssen discovered a new spectral line corresponding to a new element, Helium.	Pierre-Jules-César Janssen	France	spectral-lines-and-elements, transatlantic-liner	Space	Improvements in transportation had made it possible for astronomers to travel all over the world if they had to. The most spectacular astronomical phenomenon that might be confined to a small area almost anywhere in the world was a total eclipse of the Sun. When an eclipse was due to be visible at certain areas in India in 1868, European astronomers didn’t hesitate to make the journey. A French astronomer at the site, Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, studied the spectra of the solar prominences. Meanwhile, a British astronomer, Joseph Norman Lockyer, showed that by allowing light from the edge of the Sun to pass through a prism, he could obtain spectra of prominences even without an eclipse. Janssen observed a spectral line that did not match any of the known lines in position. He sent a report on this to Lockyer, who decided that the line represented a hitherto unknown element. The element was named helium, from the Greek word for 'sun.'		
cro-magnon-man	1868	Cro-magnon man	The discovery of Cro-Magnon man in a cave revealed that these humans were around thirty-five thousand years old, indicating an early form of modern humans. This finding challenged the belief that the human race was far younger and shed light on human evolution.	Édouard-Armand-Isidore-Hippolyte Lartet	France	neanderthal-man	Science:Archaeology	In 1868, a French paleontologist discovered four skeletons of human beings in a cave called Cro-Magnon. They were around thirty-five thousand years old but human in every respect, demonstrating that this earlier form of human was significantly older than previously thought.		
deep-sea-life	1868	Deep-sea life	The discovery of deep-sea life revealed that living organisms could thrive in depths far lower than light could reach. This groundbreaking finding expanded our understanding of marine biology and the adaptability of life forms.	Charles Wyville Thomson	England	telegraph-plateau	Science:Biology	In 1868, a British zoologist began deep-sea dredging operations, leading to the identification of life forms thriving in the depths of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans. This research showed that life exists from the ocean's surface to its depths, even though deep-sea life does not live in the same profusion as surface life.		
periodic-table-of-the-elements	1869	Periodic table of the elements	Arranging elements in order of increasing atomic weight, Mendeleev allowed the length of periods to vary according to the properties of elements, creating a table that predicted undiscovered elements. His periodic table became the foundation for modern chemistry, providing a systematic way to understand element properties and interactions.	Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev	Russia	law-of-octaves	Science:Chemistry	In Mendeleev's original periodic table of 1871, the periods were listed vertically and groups horizontally, with elements arranged by increasing atomic weight. He predicted the existence and properties of then-undiscovered elements by leaving gaps, some of which were later filled by actual discoveries such as eka-silicon (germanium). This new organization allowed for periodic trends and valences to be more apparent, leading to a comprehensive understanding of chemical properties and behaviors.		
nucleic-acid	1869	Nucleic acid	A substance was isolated from cell remnants that did not belong to the known classes of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. This substance was later identified as nucleic acid and contained nitrogen and phosphorus.	Johann Friedrich Miescher	Switzerland	food-classification	Science:Biology	The classification of foodstuffs into carbohydrates, fats, and proteins was satisfactory until 1869. In that year, a Swiss biochemist isolated a substance in cell nuclei, named 'nuclein', that contained nitrogen and phosphorus and did not belong to any known classes of foodstuffs. The true importance of nuclein, later known as nucleic acid, was appreciated when it was revealed as essential to the cell's functions.		
critical-temperature	1869	Critical temperature	An Irish physical chemist determined the specific temperature above which gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. This concept became essential for chemists working with permanent gases.	Thomas Andrews	Ireland	permanent-gases	Science:Physics	An Irish physical chemist studied the liquefaction of gases, particularly carbon dioxide. He discovered that as the temperature rose, more pressure was needed to liquefy it until it reached a critical temperature at which only lower temperatures could enable liquefaction. This critical temperature was crucial for chemists dealing with so-called permanent gases.		
biogeography	1869	Biogeography	A naturalist developed the concept separating animal species of Australia and Asia, marking a distinct ecological divide that laid the foundations of biogeography. "Wallace's line" drew a clear separation between the evolutionary paths of species on the two continents.	Alfred Russel Wallace	England	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science:Geography	A naturalist noticed significant differences between the animal species of Australia and Asia, leading him to delineate a boundary, known as Wallace's line, which separates these two distinct groups. This realization laid the groundwork for the science of biogeography, which explores the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time.		
islets-of-langerhans	1869	Islets of langerhans	A German physician identified clusters of cells within the pancreas that produce hormones essential for regulating blood sugar levels. These clusters were named the Islets of Langerhans after their discoverer.	Paul Langerhans	Germany	diabetes	Science:Biology	A German physician, while studying the microscopic structure of the pancreas, identified numerous small, distinct clusters of cells. These cell clusters, later named Islets of Langerhans, were found to play a crucial role in producing hormones that regulate blood sugar levels, significantly advancing the understanding of endocrine pancreas function.		
celluloid	1869	Celluloid	Celluloid is the first commercially successful plastic, made from pyroxylin and used for various materials like baby rattles, shirt collars, and photographic film. Its light, flexible, and waterproof properties greatly impacted the manufacturing of household items despite its flammability.	John Wesley Hyatt	United States	pyroxylin	Science: Chemistry	Celluloid is a type of plastic material originally made from pyroxylin. It was invented to find a cheaper alternative to ivory for billiard balls. Although it did not win the prize for this purpose, it found practical applications in various products due to its light, flexible, waterproof, and easy-to-clean properties. However, its flammable nature was a significant drawback. Regardless, it marked the advent of commercially viable plastics.		
stock-ticker	1869	Stock ticker	The stock ticker, a telegraph machine for transmitting gold prices, revolutionized financial communication by providing real-time stock market information. It played a significant role in the efficiency and effectiveness of financial trading.	Thomas Alva Edison	United States	telegraph	Design	The stock ticker was invented by Thomas Alva Edison after observing the inefficient methods in a broker's office. This telegraph machine transmitted gold prices and other stock information, allowing investors to receive timely updates. The invention of the stock ticker dramatically improved the speed and reliability of financial transactions, making a lasting impact on Wall Street and the financial industry.		
troy	1870	Troy	Discovery of multiple ancient sites of immense historical interest in present-day Turkey. Heinrich Schliemann used Homer's Iliad to locate the remains and various artifacts, notably contributing to archaeological research.	Heinrich Schliemann	Germany	literature	Science:Archaeology	The ancient non-Biblical site of most interest to Europeans was surely Troy, in what is now the northwestern part of Asian Turkey. It was there that the semilegendary Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C., and many who had read Homer's Iliad in the last twenty-five centuries had thought there was a historical basis to it. One of the believers was a German businessman, Heinrich Schliemann, who worked hard to make a fortune, for the sole purpose of using it to locate the ruined city of Troy. In 1870 he went to Turkey, managed to choose the right spot (following the description in the Iliad), and uncovered a series of ancient cities, built one on top of the other. He obtained various fascinating artifacts, many of them made of gold. Although Schliemann was not the first archaeologist, and was a very unscientific one, ruining a great deal more than he found, his findings were sensational and rang through the world. His work was a great stimulant to archaeological research in general.		
human-evolution	1871	Human evolution	Darwin published "Descent of Man" discussing the principles of evolution as it specifically applies to humans. The publication emphasizes the role of biological evolution in shaping human life and identifies vestigial organs as evidence for evolution.	Charles Darwin	England	evolution-by-natural-selection, cro-magnon-man	Science:Biology	Darwin, writing his book on evolution, had initially refrained from discussing human evolution to avoid controversy. In 1871, he published *The Descent of Man,* which applied the principles of evolution to humanity, highlighting the significance of biological evolution in human development. He pointed out vestigial organs in humans as evidence for evolution from nonhuman animals.		
dry-plates	1871	Dry plates	A development in photography that allowed the use of dry solutions instead of collodion, making it easier and faster to produce photographs. This innovation increased the sensitivity and ease of use in photographic processes.	Joseph Wilson Swan	England	photography	Design:Photography	Until this invention, photography relied on solutions smeared on plates or films, which were difficult to handle. Swan found that heating these solutions increased their sensitivity and drying them made the results more consistent. The use of dry plates revolutionized photography by reducing exposure times and simplifying the photographic process.		
plant-strains	1871	Plant strains	The cultivation and development of new plant strains that demonstrated the variation within species and supported the theory of evolution through natural selection. This work highlighted the potential for creating new varieties of plants through careful selection and breeding.	Luther Burbank	United States	evolution-by-natural-selection, genetics	Science:Botany	Luther Burbank began his extensive work on cultivating new plant strains. He specialized in producing new fruit strains and developed sixty varieties of plums among other plants. His work provided clear examples of the capacity for variation within organisms and supported Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.		
gilgamesh	1872	Gilgamesh found	The epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest literary work, was uncovered and it contained a flood story similar to the Biblical tales. This discovery further increased popular interest in archaeology.	George Smith	England	literature, cuneiform-decipherment	Culture	The last great king of the Assyrian Empire, Ashurbanipal, had patronized art and literature and established a large library in Nineveh. In the 1860s, British archaeologists excavated the site of ruined Nineveh and brought cuneiform tablets back to the British Museum. George Smith, an expert at reading cuneiform, discovered the epic of Gilgamesh in 1872 and announced it contained a flood story used by Biblical writers. This created a large sensation and increased popular interest in archaeology.		
bacteriology	1872	Bacteriology	Bacteriology, the study of bacteria, became prominent when it was discovered that numerous bacteria were pathogenic. They are also extremely resilient, capable of surviving desiccation and boiling. This field of study advanced the understanding of diseases and their contagious nature.	Ferdinand Julius Cohn	Germany	germ-theory-of-disease	Science:Biology	Bacteria, known for two centuries, were not studied in detail until Pasteur's germ theory of disease in 1862. A German botanist, inspired by Pasteur's work, was the first to treat bacteriology as a special branch of knowledge in 1872. It was discovered that some bacteria were pathogenic, causing certain diseases and their contagious character.		
stellar-photography	1872	Stellar photography	This involves photographing a star’s spectrum to study light sources. It eventually allowed astronomers to photograph the spectra of over a hundred stars.	Henry Draper	United States	photography-of-the-moon, dry-plates	Space	The American astronomer Henry Draper was the first to photograph a star’s spectrum (that of Vega). As Draper adopted the use of dry plates, stellar photography became easier, facilitating the capture of the spectra of numerous stars.		
experimental-psychology	1872	Experimental psychology	Experimental psychology was initiated to measure facets of human behavior using scientific methods. It includes the establishment of laboratories and journals for publishing behavioral findings.	Wilhelm Wundt	Germany	phrenology	Science:Psychology	Wilhelm Wundt suggested that aspects of human behavior could be measured profitably. He wrote a textbook on the subject and later established the first laboratory and journal dedicated to experimental psychology.		
gas-laws	1873	Gas laws	van der Waals showed that gases follow certain laws relating volume, pressure, and temperature only if the molecules have a small volume and a small attraction between them. His demonstration refined the earlier understanding established by Boyle and others.	Johannes Diderik van der Waals	Netherlands	boyles-law, diffusion	Science:Chemistry	Johannes Diderik van der Waals showed that gases follow certain laws relating volume, pressure, and temperature only if the molecules have a small volume and a small attraction between them. His demonstration refined the earlier understanding established by Boyle and others.		
leprosy	1873	Leprosy	A bacterium was discovered as the cause of leprosy, which led to the disease being named Hansen's disease. This marked the first discovery of a microorganism causing a specific disease, providing a breakthrough in medical microbiology.	Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen	Norway	bacteriology	Science:Biology	In 1873, a Norwegian physician discovered that a specific bacterium was the cause of leprosy, and as a result, it became known as Hansen's disease. This pivotal discovery marked the first occasion where a specific microorganism was identified as causing a particular disease, significantly advancing the field of medical microbiology and the understanding of infectious diseases.		
transcendental-e	1873	Transcendental e	Hermite proved that e (a very important mathematical constant ~ 2.71828) is a transcendental number. Transcendental numbers cannot be solutions to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients.	Charles Hermite	France	transcendental-numbers	Math	In 1873, a French mathematician succeeded in proving that e (a very important mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828) is a transcendental number. This significant discovery involved proving that certain numbers, called transcendental numbers, cannot be solutions to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients, thus expanding the knowledge of irrational numbers in mathematics.		
platelets	1873	Platelets	Platelets, also called thrombocytes, were identified and studied, revealing their role in blood clotting. This discovery marked a crucial advancement in hematology and understanding of blood components.	William Osler	Canada	red-blood-cells	Science:Medicine	In 1873, a Canadian physician studied platelets (small cells in the blood) which are fewer in number than red and white blood cells, but play a crucial role in blood clotting. These cells, called thrombocytes, were extensively studied for their shape and function, leading to important discoveries about their role in the clotting process and significance in medical hematology.		
gallium	1874	Gallium	A new element named gallium was discovered, displaying unique spectral lines and validating predictions made in the periodic table. This discovery firmly established Mendeleyev’s table, confirming it for subsequent scientific exploration.	Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran	France	periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science:Chemistry	The discovery of new elements continued after Mendeleyev announced his periodic table of elements. In 1874, the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran found a zinc ore that displayed previously unknown spectral lines. He extracted the new element and named it gallium, from the old Latin word for the area that later became France after the fall of the Roman Empire. Mendeleyev had predicted this element as eka-aluminium, and gallium's characteristics and properties aligned with his prediction, solidifying the validity of the periodic table.		
tetrahedral-carbon-atom	1874	Tetrahedral carbon atom	A new three-dimensional representation of organic molecules demonstrated that molecules must be asymmetric to rotate polarized light, showing that the four valence bonds of the carbon atom pointed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron. 	Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff	Netherlands	organic-molecular-structure, geometry, polarized-light	Science:Chemistry	Kekule's earlier two-dimensional models of organic molecules had limitations, as some molecules in solution rotated the plane of polarized light, implying necessary asymmetry. In 1874, Dutch physical chemist Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff advanced this understanding by creating a three-dimensional model. He showed that the four valence bonds of the carbon atom pointed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron, with one bond pointing upward and three arranged equally below, illustrating the essential structural asymmetry of organic molecules in achieving specific chemical behaviors.		
transfinite-numbers	1874	Transfinite numbers	The invention of transfinite numbers illustrates an endless series of numbers larger than the ordinary infinity of integers. This concept revolutionized mathematical understanding of infinity and real numbers.	Ludwig Philipp Cantor	Germany	decimal-notation	Math	The German mathematician Ludwig Philipp Cantor introduced the concept of transfinite numbers, addressing the troublesome notion of infinity. He demonstrated that while all fractions (rational numbers) are countable through one-to-one correspondence, real numbers (rational and irrational) are not, representing a higher form of infinity. This mathematical innovation showed that real numbers exist in an endlessly larger quantity, changing our approach to infinity and counting.		
current-and-crystals	1874	Current and crystals	It was discovered that in some crystals, electric current can pass through in one direction but not the other. This finding later led to significant advancements in electronics and technology.	Karl Ferdinand Braun	Germany	electrical-conductance, crystallography	Science: Physics	German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun observed in 1874 that some crystals allowed electric current to pass through in one direction but not the other. At the time, the full implications and reasons were not clear, but this curious observation paved the way for later technological advancements, particularly in the development of diodes and semiconductor technology.		
fertilization-observed	1875	Fertilization	Fertilization was observed when a sperm cell entered an egg cell of a sea urchin, confirming that a union of both was necessary for the birth of young. This observation greatly advanced the understanding of reproductive biology.	Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig	Germany	fertilization	Science:Biology	Egg cells and sperm cells were both known, and it was clear that the birth of young required a union of the two. Nevertheless, such a union was not observed until the German embryologist Oskar Wilhelm August Hertwig saw a sperm cell actually enter the egg cell of a sea urchin. What's more, although sperm cells are produced in swarming plenty, Hertwig could see that but a single sperm cell entered the egg cell and that it sufficed for fertilization.		
radiometer	1875	Radiometer	The radiometer was created to demonstrate the effects of solar radiation by using pivoted vanes (one side blackened, the other shiny) in a vacuum that turned when exposed to sunlight. It provided vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.	William Crookes	England	geissler-tubes, kinetic-theory-of-gases	Science:Physics	In 1875 Crookes devised the radiometer, consisting of a set of pivoted vanes in a vacuum. One side of each vane was blackened so that it would absorb heat, and the other side was shiny so that it would reflect it. In the presence of sunlight, the vanes turned steadily. This was not due to solar radiation, for if the container was evacuated particularly well, the motion ceased. Actually, the air molecules in the imperfect vacuum rebounded from the heated side more strongly than from the cooler, shiny side, thus 'kicking' it around. This required a partial vacuum to work, as otherwise air resistance would muffle the motion. The radiometer was only a toy, but it offered vivid support for the kinetic theory of gases.		
telephone	1876	Telephone	The telephone was invented to transmit spoken words over wires by converting sound waves into electric currents. This allowed sound to be sent and received over long distances, revolutionizing communication.	Alexander Graham Bell	United States	telegraph	Science:Technology	The telegraph, now over thirty years old, transmitted only signals. The British-born American inventor Alexander Graham Bell wanted something better than that. He wanted to send actual speech over the wires, by turning sound waves into a fluctuating electric current that waxed and waned as the sound waves compressed and decompressed air. The electric current could then be reconverted into sound at the other end. He finally invented a device capable of doing that and first made use of it accidentally. He had spilled battery acid on his pants.		
four-stroke-engine	1876	Four-stroke engine	The four-stroke engine involves the piston making four strokes—intake, compression, power, and exhaust—which improved the efficiency of internal combustion engines. This invention had a significant impact on the development of automobiles and various machinery.	Nikolaus August Otto	Germany	internal-combustion-engine	Science:Engineering	The Lenoir internal-combustion engine had been developed sixteen years earlier, but its inefficiency was recognized. A German engineer, Nikolaus August Otto, built a version in which the piston made four strokes—intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This cycle allowed for more efficient fuel burning and energy conversion, paving the way for the modern internal combustion engine used in cars and other machinery.		
chemical-thermodynamics	1876	Chemical thermodynamics	Thermodynamics principles were applied to chemical reactions, evolving the modern concepts of energy and chemical potential. He also explored equilibria involving different phases and the number of ways temperature, pressure, or concentration interrelate. This application helped in understanding equilibria and the phase rule, influencing various scientific fields.	Josiah Willard Gibbs	United States	second-law-of-thermodynamics	Science: Chemistry	Thermodynamics, initially developed through the study of heat, was applied to chemical changes. In a series of papers, an American physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs, discussed how energy and chemical potential drive chemical reactions. He also explored equilibria involving different phases and the number of ways temperature, pressure, or concentration can vary, which can be expressed by the phase rule. This work significantly contributed to the field of chemical thermodynamics.		
bacterial-cultivation	1876	Bacterial cultivation	The bacteria causing anthrax was identified, isolated, and grown outside a living body, finding a practical application for Pasteur's germ theory. He later learned to grow bacteria inside gelatin or agar. This advancement allowed for better understanding and control of infectious diseases.	Robert Koch	Germany	germ-theory-of-disease	Science: Biology	During an anthrax epidemic in eastern Germany, physician Robert Koch identified the bacterium causing the disease. He successfully isolated and cultivated the bacteria outside living organisms using blood serum at body temperature and later solid media like gelatin and agar. These methods allowed him to prove that a particular strain of bacteria was responsible for the disease, providing a concrete application of germ theory and aiding in the research for disease prevention and cures.		
cathode-rays	1876	Cathode rays	Cathode rays were defined as streams of radiation traveling from the negatively charged electrode in a vacuum tube. This discovery paved the way for further research in electron physics and the development of electronic devices.	Eugen Goldstein	Germany	electricity-in-a-vacuum, lightning-rod	Science: Physics	German physicist Eugen Goldstein investigated the passage of electric currents through a vacuum and observed fluorescence near the cathode, indicating radiation known as cathode rays. This phenomenon showed that these rays consisted of negatively charged particles, contributing to the early understanding of electron behavior and influencing subsequent experiments in the field of electron physics.		
protein-size	1877	Protein size	Explained how certain substances could pass through membranes while others could not and presented the concept of osmotic pressure. This work laid the foundation for calculating molecular weights of proteins and understanding macromolecules.	Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer	Germany	osmosis	Science:Biology	The fact of osmosis—that some substances could go through certain membranes while others could not—had been known for two decades. In 1877 a German botanist Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp Pfeffer (1845–1920), explained the phenomenon by showing that large molecules would not go through, while small ones would. If all the large molecules were on one side of the membrane, they would block the passage of some of the small ones. That meant that more small molecules would pass through from the side that lacked the large molecules. The side with the large molecules would then swell, as more small molecules entered than left, and it would experience an osmotic pressure. Pfeffer showed how one might measure this osmotic pressure and related that pressure to the size of the molecules that could not pass through the membrane. If a particular protein was on one side of the membrane, then from the osmotic pressure developed on that side Pfeffer could calculate the molecular weight of the protein. Pfeffer was also the first to determine the molecular weights of proteins and to show that they were macromolecules made up of hundreds, even thousands, of atoms.		
liquid-oxygen	1877	Liquid oxygen	Progress in the liquefaction of gases led to cooling oxygen and other gases to extreme temperatures, creating liquid oxygen. This discovery enabled advancements in physics and chemistry related to gas properties and behaviors.	Louis-Paul Cailletet and Raoul-Pierre Pictet	France	critical-temperature, gas-laws, liquefying-gases	Science:Chemistry	The work of Andrews (see 1869) and of van der Waals (see 1873) had emphasized the fact that gases that resisted liquefaction had to be cooled as far as possible before pressure could be usefully applied, or the Joule-Thomson cooling-by-expansion effect attempted. In 1877 a French physicist, Louis-Paul Cailletet (1832–1913), cooled oxygen intensively and then let it expand. He got a fog of liquid droplets of oxygen. By using similar techniques, he also managed to get small quantities of liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon monoxide as well. A Swiss chemist, Raoul-Pierre Pictet (1846–1929), managed to do this independently in the same year. Using a more elaborate method, he produced greater quantities of the liquids. As it turned out, oxygen liquefied at −183° C (90° K); carbon monoxide at −191° C (82° K); and nitrogen at −196° C (77° K). The only known gas that remained a gas at the temperature that sufficed to liquefy nitrogen was hydrogen. (Two other gases, as yet unknown, would also have remained unliquefiable at this time.)		
phonograph	1877	Phonograph	The phonograph is a device that records and reproduces sound. It significantly contributed to the music industry by enabling the mechanical recording and playback of sound.	Thomas Edison	United States	telephone	General	In 1876 Edison had opened the first industrial research laboratory, at Menlo Park, New Jersey. In 1877, he improved the telephone mouthpiece in a crucial manner and invented the phonograph. He put tinfoil on a cylinder, set a free-floating needle skimming over it as the cylinder turned, and connected a source that would carry sound waves to the needle. The needle then impressed a track on the tinfoil, which could later reproduce the sound. This invention led to the eventual creation of various music playback technologies.		
martian-canals	1877	Martian canals	Martian canals were perceived networks of linear markings on Mars that were thought to be channels filled with water and built by intelligent beings. This lead to significant speculation about advanced Martian civilizations.	Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli	Italy	martian-ice-caps	Space	Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed Mars during a close approach to Earth in 1877. He saw markings that he interpreted as water channels and named them 'canali', which was mistranslated to 'canals' in English. This led to the widespread belief that these were constructed by intelligent Martian beings to carry water from polar ice caps to the equatorial regions of Mars.		
martian-satellites	1877	Martian moons	Two small Martian satellites were discovered and named Phobos and Deimos after the sons of Ares. This contributed to the understanding of planetary systems and the natural satellites of other planets.	Asaph Hall	United States	jupiter-moons, ariel-and-umbriel	Space	In 1877, during a conjunction of Earth and Mars, American astronomer Asaph Hall seized the opportunity to confirm if Mars had any natural satellites. Using improved telescopes, Hall discovered two small satellites, later named Phobos and Deimos. These satellites helped deepen the understanding of Mars and its celestial system while debunking previous assumptions that Mars did not have any satellites.		
enzyme	1878	Enzyme	Previously, living catalysts were called ferments. Kuhne suggested that non-living substances that act as biological catalysts be called enzymes. Eventually the name enzyme came to be applied to living and non-living biological catalysts.	Wilhelm Friedrich Kühne	Germany	catalysis	Science:Biology	In 1878, Wilhelm Friedrich Kühne proposed that substances exerting catalytic effects in biological systems should be called enzymes, derived from the Greek meaning 'in yeast.' This shifted the perception from considering these catalysts as alive to recognizing their universal role in biological reactions, irrespective of their existence in living or isolated forms.		
varves	1878	Varves	Layered sediments in glacial-fed lakes were studied by counting the varves (Swedish for "layers") and estimating a glacier's age in (12,000 years) with considerable accuracy. This discovery was pivotal in identifying seasonal patterns in sediment deposition and their correlation with glacial and interglacial periods.	Gerard Jakob de Geer	Sweden	ice-age	Science:Geology	A Swedish geologist, Gerard Jakob de Geer, conducted studies in 1878 on finest and coarser sediment layers in glacier-fed lakes. His work showed that these layers alternated seasonally, revealing significant insights into the duration and intervals of ice ages and interglacial periods.		
ytterbium	1878	Ytterbium	Discovery of ytterbium added to the list of elements isolated from rare earths. This contribution expanded the known elements, aiding further chemical research and application.	Jean-Charles-Galissard de Marignac	Switzerland	rare-earths	Science:Chemistry	Six elements had been isolated from rare earths, but in 1878, the discovery of ytterbium by Jean-Charles-Galissard de Marignac added another element to this list. Named after the Ytterby quarry where the first rare earth was discovered, ytterbium's discovery helped enhance the understanding and utilization of rare earth elements in various fields.		
electric-light	1879	Electric light	Electric light involves using a wire filament heated to incandescence in a vacuum-sealed bulb, which provides safer and more reliable lighting compared to previous methods. This invention significantly impacted daily life and industry by providing a practical and widespread lighting solution.	Thomas Edison	United States	gas-lighting, geissler-tubes	Science:Physics	With a source of energy like electricity, there seemed a chance of having light without flame. A current forced across an air gap can produce a bright spark, and arc lights had been previously introduced, but the light was harsh and the danger of fire was great. The problem tackled was finding an alternate form of electric lighting. Electricity passing through a wire warmed it because of the wire’s resistance. If the resistance was made great enough by making the wire thin, the wire would heat to incandescence but could either melt or burn. To prevent burning, the wire filament had to be in an evacuated glass bulb to soften the light and lessen the danger of fire. Finding a conductor that would not melt was the next problem. After thousands of experiments, a solution was found with a scorched cotton thread, equivalent to a carbon wire, which allowed the light to burn for 40 continuous hours. A patent was obtained, and the electric light bulbs were used to illuminate the main street of Menlo Park. To make the light bulb useful, a generating system with electric current provision to homes, factories, and other installations was also developed.		
origin-of-the-moon	1879	Origin of the moon	This hypothesis suggests that the Moon was once part of the Earth and spun off due to the Earth's rapid rotation in its early primordial times. This idea highlights the exchange of angular momentum between the Earth and the Moon, contributing to the lengthening of Earth's day over time.	George Howard Darwin	England	laws-motion	Space	Newton believed that tides were solely a result of the Moon's gravitational pull. George Darwin proposed that as Earth's rotation slowed, its angular momentum was conserved by the Moon gradually moving away from the Earth. This momentum exchange implies that the Moon was once part of Earth, breaking away due to rapid primordial spin. Despite the hypothesis being dramatic and not accepted today, it offered an early explanation for the Earth-Moon system's evolution.		
saccharin	1879	Saccharin	Saccharin is a sweet-tasting compound discovered accidentally during the synthesis of ortho-benzoyl sulfimide. It marked the beginning of artificial sweeteners, providing a substitute for sugar that remains significant today.	Constantine Fahlberg and Ira Remsen	United States	organic-synthesis	Science:Chemistry	In 1879, chemist Constantine Fahlberg, while working on ortho-benzoyl sulfimide, accidentally tasted a sweet compound that had adhered to his fingers. Named saccharin, it was the first commercial sugar substitute, dramatically impacting the food industry by offering an alternative to sugar which is still in use today.		
scandium	1879	Scandium	Scandium is a chemical element discovered as part of the rare earth series but with distinct properties that fulfilled predictions made by Dmitri Mendeleyev. Its discovery reinforced the periodic table by fitting the properties of the previously predicted 'eka-boron'.	Lars Fredrik Nilson	Sweden	rare-earths, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science:Chemistry	Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered scandium in 1879, identifying it as part of the rare earth elements but with unique properties. Following this, chemist Per Teodor Cleve confirmed that scandium's characteristics matched those of 'eka-boron', a predicted element by Dmitri Mendeleyev, thus verifying the predictive power of the periodic table.		
thulium-holmium-samarium	1879	Thulium, holmium, and samarium	Two new rare earth elements, thulium (after Thule) and holmium (after Stockholm), were discovered and named to reflect Scandinavian connections. Another rare earth element, samarium, was also identified in the same year.	Per Teodor Cleve 	Sweden	scandium	Science:Chemistry	If scandium was not quite a rare earth element, other elements were discovered that were. Cleve, who identified scandium as eka-boron (see above), isolated two new rare earth elements in 1879. He gave both of them names of Scandinavian aura. One was thulium, after Thule, which in classic legend was the land farthest to the north, and which was interpreted by later Europeans as representing Scandinavia. The other he named holmium, after Stockholm. In the same year, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who had discovered gallium (see 1874), identified a new rare earth element, which he named samarium, because he had found it in a mineral called samarskite, which, in turn, bore the name of an otherwise obscure Russian mining engineer named Samarski.		
heat-and-radiation	1879	Heat and radiation	The relationship between a body’s temperature and the radiation it emits was established, revealing that radiation increases dramatically with temperature (T^4). This principle, known as Stefan's law, has significant implications for understanding stellar evolution and the radiation of the Sun.	Josef Stefan	Austria	black-bodies	Science:Physics	An Austrian physicist, Josef Stefan (1835-1893), was particularly interested in how hot bodies cooled and, therefore, in how much radiation they emitted. He studied hot bodies over a considerable range of temperature and, in 1879, was able to show that the total radiation of a body was proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (Stefan's law). For example, if a body's temperature tripled, from 1,000° K to 3,000° K, its radiation output would increase 3 x 3 x 3 x 3, or 81 times. This very rapid increase of radiation with temperature was more of an increase than would have been expected and turned out to be of great use in deducing the evolution of stars. More immediately, from the total radiation of the Sun, its surface temperature was deduced from the rule, and turned out to be about 5,700° K.		
malaria	1880	Malaria	The disease-causing microorganism for malaria was discovered to be a protozoon rather than a bacterium. This groundbreaking discovery earned a Nobel Prize and advanced the understanding of malaria's pathology.	Charles-Louis-Alphonse Laveran	France	quinine, bacteriology	Science: Biology	In 1880 a French physician, Charles-Louis-Alphonse Laveran (1845-1922), isolated the microorganism that caused malaria and, to everyone's astonishment, found it to be not a bacterium but a protozoon, a one-celled animal. It was the first pathogenic organism to be found that was anything but a bacterium. For this discovery, Laveran received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1907.		
nebular-photography	1880	Nebular photography	The first photograph of a nebula was taken, shedding light on the composition and characteristics of the Orion nebula. This milestone in astrophotography allowed for significant insights into the nature of nebulas.	Henry Draper	United States	dry-plates	Space	In 1880 Draper (see 1872), who had learned the use of dry plates from Huggins (see 1863), used the new technique to photograph the Orion nebula and to study its spectrum. It was the first time a nebula had been photographed. From its spectrum, it was possible to deduce that the Orion nebula was a cloud of dust and gas lit by stars that must be embedded in it. It would be natural to suppose, as a result, that all other nebulas might be of such composition, but within forty years it turned out that there were all-important exceptions.		
modern-seismograph	1880	Modern seismograph	Advancements were made in developing the first modern seismograph to measure earthquake strength, using a horizontal pendulum system. This development marked the beginning of modern seismology and led to the establishment of seismograph chains worldwide.	John Milne	England	seismograph	Science: Geology	The first attempt to develop a device that would measure the strength of earthquakes had been made by Palmieri (see 1855). In 1880 the first modern seismograph (from Greek words meaning “to record earthquakes”) was devised by a British geologist, John Milne (1850–1913). This was, essentially, a horizontal pendulum, one end of which was fixed in bedrock. When the ground moved as a result of a quake, the motion was re-corded on a turning drum by a pen (eventually by a ray of light). Milne established a chain of seismographs in Japan and elsewhere, which marked the beginning of modern seismology.		
gadolinium	1880	Gadolinium	A new rare earth element, gadolinium, was discovered and named in honor of Gadolin, adding to the known elements in the periodic table. This discovery underscored the ongoing advancements in the field of chemistry.	Jean-Charles-Galissard de Marignac	Switzerland	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	Maringac, who had discovered ytterbium (see 1878), discovered yet another rare earth element in 1880. This time Gadolin, who had discovered the rare earths (see 1794), was honored, and the element was named gadolinium.		
unconscious-mind	1880	Unconscious mind	A significant case in psychology involving patient 'Anna O.' was recorded, in which Anna's symptoms were alleviated when she could be asked to verbalize the fantasies of her unconscious mind. This case contributed to the early foundations of psychoanalysis.	Josef Breuer	Austria	experimental-psychology	Science: Psychology	In 1880 an Austrian physician, Josef Breuer (1842–1925), acquired a new patient whom he referred to as “Anna O.” She suffered from various psychological issues.		
electromechanical-calculator	1880	Electromechanical calculator	The electromechanical calculator was invented, which used punch cards and electricity to efficiently handle and analyze vast amounts of census data. This invention led to the creation of IBM, impacting data processing significantly.	Herman Hollerith	United States	jacquard-loom, mortality-tables, calculating-machines	Science: Computing	The American census was growing more and more elaborate. There were more and more people, and more and more questions were being asked of each person. The information gathered was so voluminous that it took literally years to sort it. An American inventor, Herman Hollerith (1860-1929), who worked for the census, thought there might be a better way of handling the data, and beginning in 1880, he set about the task. He made use of punch cards after the fashion of Jacquard (see 1801) and Babbage (see 1822). Each card could be punched to represent data gathered in the census: holes in appropriate places could represent sex, age, occupation, and so on. In order to add up and analyze all this information, the cards were placed on a stand and a metal device was pressed down against them. The device had many pins, which would be stopped by the cardboard. Wherever there was a hole, however, a pin would go through and reach a pool of mercury underneath. Electricity would pass through that pin and control the pointer on a dial. As the punch cards were sent rapidly through the machine, it was only necessary for people to record the numbers indicated on the dial. What made all the difference between Hollerith and Babbage was that Hollerith had the use of electricity. He had developed an electromechanical calculator, and not merely a mechanical one. Eventually, Hollerith founded a company devoted to making all kinds of machines that could handle and analyze information. That company developed into the International Business Machines Corporation, usually known simply as IBM.		
charged-cathode-rays	1880	Charged cathode rays	Cathode rays were shown to be a stream of negatively charged particles, as opposed to a form of electromagnetic radiation. This discovery clarified the nature of cathode rays, contributing to the understanding of atomic structure.	William Crookes	England	cathode-rays	Science: Physics	There was some question about the nature of the cathode rays to which Goldstein had given a name (see 1876). Most of the reported observations could be explained equally well by supposing cathode rays to be either a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light, or a stream of particles. The matter was investigated by Crookes (see 1861), who in 1875 had devised a vacuum tube that was even better than Geissler’s (see 1855). In 1880, using his own Crookes tube, he showed that cathode rays traveled in straight lines and cast sharp shadows. The radiation could even turn a small wheel, which it struck on one side. This still left the nature of the rays uncertain. But then Crookes showed that a magnet would cause cathode rays to curve in their path, and from the manner of curving, it seemed quite certain that they carried a negative electric charge. Since there seemed no way electromagnetic waves could carry such a charge, Crookes concluded that cathode rays were actually a stream of negatives particles.		
high-pressure	1880	High pressure	A French physicist managed to reach a pressure equal to 3,000 atmospheres, setting a record and laying the groundwork for future work in extreme pressures. This contributed to the study and understanding of the behavior of materials under extreme conditions.	Emile Hilaire Amagat	France	boyles-law, liquefying-gases	Science: Physics	Scientists starting with Boyle (see 1662) had used pressure to study the compression of gases or, as Faraday had, to bring about the liquefaction of gases (see 1823). A French physicist, Emile Hilaire Amagat (1841-1915), was the first, though, to attempt to reach really high pressures and study the behavior of materials under those conditions. He began his experiments in 1880 and soon managed to attain a pressure equal to 3,000 atmospheres. It set a record and laid the groundwork for further work in decades to come at still more extreme pressures.		
piezoelectricity	1880	Piezoelectricity	A crystal of quartz was found to generate an electric potential when subjected to pressure, a phenomenon known as piezoelectricity. If, in reverse, the crystal was subjected to electricity, it would compress as though under pressure, discovering a way to produce ultrasonic vibrations. This led to microphones and record players.	Pierre Curie	France	laws-of-electrolysis	Science: Physics	In 1880 a French chemist, Pierre Curie (1859-1906), noted that if a crystal of quartz was placed under pressure, an electric potential appeared across it. If, in reverse, the crystal was subjected to an electric potential, it would compress as though under pressure. If the electric potential changed rapidly, the crystal would compress and expand in time with the change, and the vibration of the crystal would set up sound waves that oscillated too rapidly to be heard. Curie had thus discovered a way of producing ultrasonic vibrations. The manner in which this is done—the interaction of pressure and electric potentials—is known as piezoelectricity, where piezo comes from the Greek word for “pressure.” Crystals with piezoelectric properties came to form an essential portion of sound-electronic devices such as microphones and record players.		
interferometer	1881	Interferometer	An interferometer was devised to precisely split a beam of light and bring it back together, enabling measurements of the light's phase differences. This experiment contributed significantly by disproving the existence of the supposed luminiferous ether.	Albert Abraham Michelson	United States	lines-of-force, light-waves, five-elements	Science: Physics	In 1881 a German-born American physicist, Albert Abraham Michelson (1852-1931), devised an interferometer, with the financial help of Bell, who had invented the telephone five years before (see 1876). This device acted to split a beam of light in two, send the parts along different paths, then bring them back together—a way of treating light that Maxwell (see 1855) had suggested six years before. Then, no one had had an instrument capable of the job; now Michelson had one. If the two portions of the light traveled precisely the same distance at the same speed, they would then come back together in phase, and the light would be unchanged. If their distance or speed were slightly different, however, the two beams would be slightly out of phase when they rejoined, and interference fringes should be set up such as those Young had detected and used to prove the wave nature of light (see 1801). At this time, it was thought that light, being a wave, had to be a wave of something. Consequently, it was supposed that all space was filled with a luminiferous ether. This luminiferous ether was thought to be in a state of absolute rest, and the Earth was thought to be moving at some particular speed relative to it, called Earth's absolute motion. Michelson used his interferometer to measure Earth's absolute motion by sending two halves of a light beam traveling at right angles to each other. Light sent in the direction of Earth's motion through the ether and back again ought to complete its trip a little sooner than light traveling across the path of Earth's motion. Michelson's experiment with multiply reflected light beams in paths at right angles to each other finally proved the nonexistence of the ether.		
anthrax-inoculation	1881	Anthrax inoculation	Developing an 'attenuated' version of anthrax that conferred immunity to domestic animals, it prevented the spread of a deadly zoonotic disease. This experiment confirmed the feasibility of creating laboratory-made, milder versions of deadly diseases.	Louis Pasteur	France	vaccination, bacterial-cultivation	Science: Biology	It had been three-quarters of a century since Jenner had successfully prevented smallpox by inoculating people with cowpox, a much milder disease that conferred immunity to the more serious one (see 1796). This feat could not be repeated in other cases because other serious diseases did not seem to have milder cousins. Pasteur decided, however, that one might be able to manufacture those milder cousins in the laboratory. Pasteur studied the deadly disease anthrax, which ravaged herds of domestic animals. Koch (see 1876) had reported observing the bacteria responsible for the disease. Pasteur confirmed Koch's finding and showed that the germs sometimes survived in the ground as heat-resistant spores for long periods of time. It was therefore necessary to kill all infected animals and bury them deep. If an animal did survive anthrax, however, it was immune thereafter. Pasteur therefore prepared cultures of anthrax germs and heated them. In this way, he destroyed the activity and virulence of the germs but left an 'attenuated' preparation that could still produce immunity against anthrax. In 1881 he carried through a dramatic experiment. Some sheep were inoculated with his attenuated germs; others were not. After a time, all the sheep seemed healthy, but when they were injected with deadly anthrax germs, those that had been inoculated lived; those that had not been inoculated died.		
pneumococcus	1881	Pneumococcus	Isolated the bacterium responsible for pneumonia, recognizing it as a small spherical type called pneumococcus. This identification facilitated the study of pneumonia's bacteriology and treatment methods.	George Miller Sternberg	United States	bacteriology	Science: Microbiology	The physician George Miller Sternberg (1838-1915) was the American pioneer in bacteriology. In 1881 he isolated the bacterium that caused pneumonia. It was a small spherical bacterium of the kind called coccus (from a Greek word meaning 'seed'). The pneumonia-causing bacterium was therefore called pneumococcus.		
venn-diagram	1881	Venn diagram	Venn diagrams visualize logical relationships using intersecting circles, simplifying the handling of logical statements. This extension of symbolic logic into geometric formats broadened the utility and understanding of logical concepts.	John Venn	England	symbolic-logic	Math	In 1881 the British mathematician John Venn (1834-1923) extended the work of Boole on symbolic logic (see 1847), by representing logical statements as intersecting circles (Venn diagrams). Such circles made it easier to handle statements like 'All A are B' or 'Some A are B' or 'A can be B or C but not both.' If Boole's work was a kind of algebraic logic, Venn's was geometric logic.		
chromatin	1882	Chromatin	Used a synthetic dye called chromatin to study the intimate details of cell structure. This unveiled different parts of a nucleus: nucleoplasm and cytoplasm was developed to better study cell substructures. Also discovered threadlike objects called chromosomes which were a big part of cell division, which Flemming called mitosis.	Eduard Adolf Strasburger & Walther Flemming	Germany	synthetic-dyes, cell-theory	Science: Biology	Studies of the intimate details of cellular structure through the microscope were hampered by the fact that the cell is transparent... German botanist Eduard Adolf Strasburger (1844-1912) was able to observe some of the changes that took place during cell division among plants. In 1882 Strasburger divided protoplasm into two regions, one inside the nucleus, which he called nucleoplasm, and the other outside the nucleus, which he called cytoplasm (the prefix cyto- is from the Greek word for 'cell'). These words, especially cytoplasm, are now common among biologists...		
speed-of-light-interferometer	1882	Speed of light interferometer	By timing a flash of light travelling between mirrors in Annapolis, the speed of light was measured to be 186,320 miles per second. This was an improvement from previous measurements and 0.02% from the modern value. 	Albert Abraham Michelson	United States	speed-of-light-experiment, interferometer	Science: Physics	Michelson (the inventor of the interferometer—see 1881), measured the speed of light in 1882 and reported it to be 186,320 miles per second. This was over a thousand miles per second faster than Foucault had reported, and Michelson's value was more accurate. In fact, it was less than 40 miles per second above the value that is currently accepted.		
diffraction-gratings-improved	1882	Improved diffraction gratings	Diffraction gratings were refined to contain around 15,000 lines per inch, enabling the creation of detailed solar spectrum maps. This advancement made it possible to analyze light with much greater precision.	Henry Augustus Rowland	United States	diffraction-gratings	Science: Physics	Fraunhofer had been the first to use diffraction gratings for the formation of light spectra (see 1820). The American physicist Henry Augustus Rowland had devised a method for preparing gratings of unexampled fineness, and in 1882, he prepared a grating in which there were almost 15,000 lines per inch. Eventually, using gratings such as these, Rowland could prepare a map of the solar spectrum in which the precise wavelengths of some 14,000 spectral lines were given.		
tuberculosis	1882	Tuberculosis	Tuberculosis was a very common disease in the nineteenth century. The bacterium causing tuberculosis, known as the tubercle bacillus, was isolated. Identifying this pathogen was a key step in the fight against tuberculosis and earned recognition with a Nobel Prize.	Robert Koch	Germany	bacteriology	Science: Biology	In 1882 Koch isolated the tubercle bacillus, the bacterium that caused tuberculosis. This led him to search for a cure, and for a while he thought he had one, but was disappointed. Still, such was the dread of the disease that merely identifying the germ seemed a feat important enough to warrant granting Koch a Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1905.		
transcendental-pi	1882	Transcendental pi	Pi was proven to be a transcendental number, meaning it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. This mathematical proof has significant implications in number theory and geometry.	Ferdinand von Lindemann	Germany	transcendental-e	Math	In 1882 the German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann studied π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Its value is 3.14159 . . . and so on, forever, in a nonrepeating decimal, for π is an irrational number. Lindemann was able to show that it was more than irrational. It was transcendental, as Hermite had theorized.		
alloy-steel	1883	Alloy steel	The addition of manganese and other metals to steel improved its durability and hardness, extending its usage, particularly in railroad rails. This development marked the start of advanced alloy steels, which incorporated various metals for further enhancements.	Robert Abbott Hadfield	England	bessemer-steel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, discovery-of-niobium	Science: Metallurgy	For three thousand years, steel (carbonized iron) had been the strongest material known for tools, structures, and weapons, but that didn't mean it couldn't be improved. Attempts were made to improve the qualities of steel by adding other metals. Manganese was one of the metals tried, but it seemed to make the steel more brittle. A British metallurgist, Robert Abbott Hadfield (1858–1940), added more manganese than others had thought advisable, however, and when the steel was 12 percent manganese, it was no longer brittle. If it was then heated to 1,000°C and quenched, it became superhard. Where ordinary steel used for railroad rails had to be replaced every nine months, rails made of manganese-steel lasted twenty-two years. Hadfield patented his manganese-steel in 1883, and that marked the beginning of the triumph of alloy steel. Other metals were then added to steel in varying quantities and mixtures—chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, and so on—in search of alloys with new and useful properties.		
alternating-currents	1883	Alternating currents	Electric generators naturally generate alternating current, which rapidly alternates between one direction and the other, with intensity rising and falling like a sine wave. Tesla constructed an induction motor to do useful work.	Nikola Tesla	Croatia	electric-generators	Science: Electrical Engineering	Electric currents, as used in the first half of the nineteenth century, flowed from one point to another in one direction. That is the kind of current one gets from batteries, and it is direct current (dc). It is easier, in		
edison-effect	1883	Edison effect	Seeking to improve his lightbulb by making the filament last longer, Edison discovered that the flow of electricity from a hot filament to a cold wire across a gap in a vacuum tube. This phenomenon laid the groundwork for the future science of electronics.	Thomas Edison	United States	electric-light	Science: Physics	Once Edison had invented the electric light, he naturally endeavoured to improve it. In particular, he wanted to make the filament last longer. In 1883 he sealed a metal wire into a light bulb near the hot filament. Perhaps he thought this might absorb some of the remaining air in the tube and lessen its destructive effect on the filament. To Edison’s surprise, electricity flowed from the hot filament to the cold wire across the gap that separated them. This is called the Edison effect. Edison wrote up the effect meticulously and patented it, as a matter of course, but he could think of no use for it. This was his only purely scientific discovery, and he didn’t follow it up. The Edison effect proved the basis for the science of electronics that was eventually to come.		
rayon	1883	Rayon	Rayon, developed by refining nitrocellulose solutions forced through tiny holes, resembled silk in its fineness and shininess. This first synthetic fiber marked the beginning of synthetic textile production.	Louis-Marie-Hilaire Bernigaud de Chardonnet	France	cellulose	Design: Textiles	The French chemist Louis-Marie-Hilaire Bernigaud de Chardonnet had begun some five years earlier to produce fibers by forcing solutions of nitrocellulose through tiny holes and allowing the solvent to evaporate. He perfected the process in 1883 and found he had a fiber that strongly resembled silk in its fineness and shininess. He called it rayon (from the French word for “a ray of light”) because of its shininess. He used only partly nitrated cellulose, so rayon wasn’t explosive, but it was still uncomfortably inflammable. Rayon was the first synthetic fiber, and it was to be followed by many others.		
meiosis	1883	Meiosis	Meiosis is the process of halving the number of chromosomes in sex cells, ensuring genetic stability across generations. Beneden discovered that the number of chromosones in each species is constant. The discovery provided crucial insight into genetic inheritance and cell division.	Edouard Joseph Louis-Marie van Beneden	Belgium	chromatin, genetics	Science: Biology	The discovery of the mechanism of cell division by Flemming (see 1882) stimulated many biologists into investigating the matter further. The Belgian cytologist Edouard Joseph Louis-Marie van Beneden found that the number of chromosomes in the cells of a particular species was always constant, though the number varied from species to species. (It is now known that there are forty-six chromosomes in human cells.) Furthermore, he discovered that in the formation of the sex cells (that is, the ova and spermatozoa), the division of chromosomes during one of the cell divisions was not preceded by a doubling. Each egg and sperm cell, therefore, ended with only half the usual number of chromosomes. (This halving of number was called meiosis, from a Greek word meaning “to make smaller”.) Consequently, when a sperm cell entered an egg cell in the process of fertilization, the chromosomes reached their normal number for the species, half of them coming from the mother and half from the father.		
phagocytes	1883	Phagocytes	Discovery of phagocytes, semi-independent cells in animals capable of ingesting small particles and bacteria, was made. This discovery highlighted the importance of white blood cells in the immune system.	Élie Metchnikoff	France	bacteriology	Science: Biology	A Russian-born French bacteriologist, Élie Metchnikoff (1845-1916), found that in simple animals there were semi-independent cells that were capable of ingesting small particles. Any damage to the animals brought these cells to the spot at once. In 1883 Metchnikoff followed up this lead and studied more complicated animals. He was able to show that the white cells in blood were also semi-independent and were capable of ingesting bacteria. The white cells flocked to the site of any infection, and what followed was a battle between bacteria and what Metchnikoff called phagocytes (Greek for 'eating cells'). When the phagocytes lost heavily, their disintegrated structures made up pus. The white cells, Metchnikoff held, were an important factor in resistance to infection and disease. For this work, he received a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1908.		
diphtheria	1883	Diphtheria	Discovery of the bacterium causing diphtheria was made. This provided crucial understanding for tackling a serious children's disease.	Edwin Klebs	Germany	bacteriology	Science: Biology	The German pathologist Edwin Klebs (1834-1913) discovered the bacterium responsible for a serious children's disease, diphtheria, in 1883.		
maxim-gun	1883	Maxim gun	The Gatling gun had to be cranked manually. The fully automatic Maxim gun was invented, utilizing bullet recoil for operation. This significantly enhanced military capabilities for European armies.	Hiram Stevens Maxim	England	machine-guns	War	The Gatling gun (see 1862) had to be cranked. In 1883 an American-born, British inventor, Hiram Stevens Maxim (1840-1916), went one step further, with a fully automatic machine gun. It made use of the energy of a fired bullet’s recoil to eject the spent cartridge and load the next. The Maxim gun gave European armies a still greater advantage over native levies in Africa and Asia. One popular jingle of the time went: 'Whatever happens, we have got The Maxim gun, and they have not!' However, the time was to come when non-Europeans found out how to use advanced weapons, and the jingle then lost its luster.		
eugenics	1883	Eugenics	Eugenics ("good breeding") was an attempt to apply selective breeding techniques from animal domestication to humans, but faced many problems, practical and ethical.	Francis Galton 	England	animal-dom, evolution-by-natural-selection	Culture			
stefan-boltzmann-law	1884	Stefan-boltzmann law	The relationship between heat emission and temperature was mathematically refined and led to the formulation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This advancement laid the foundation for statistical mechanics.	Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann	Austria	second-law-of-thermodynamics, heat-and-radiation	Science: Thermodynamics	Stefan had related heat emission to the fourth power of the temperature in 1879, and in 1884, the matter was taken up further by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann. Boltzmann increased the rigor of the mathematical treatment of thermodynamics and emphasized the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics, leading to statistical mechanics. The rule is often called the Stefan-Boltzmann law.		
ionic-dissociation	1884	Ionic dissociation	The theory of ionic dissociation explains how molecules like sodium chloride break into charged fragments called ions, which carry electric current in solution. Initially met with skepticism, it was later recognized as groundbreaking, earning the inventor a Nobel Prize.	Svante August Arrhenius	Sweden	laws-of-electrolysis	Science: Chemistry	A Swedish chemistry student, Svante August Arrhenius (1859–1927), decided that the logical way to explain this was to suppose that sodium chloride molecules broke up into two fragments of opposite electrical charge (such fragments are called ions, a word first used by Faraday—see 1821). The ions carried the current, and since there were twice as many particles as there would have been if the molecule had remained intact, this accounted for the doubled depression of the freezing point. In the same way, barium chloride must break up into three ions, and so on. In 1884 Arrhenius presented his theory of ionic dissociation as his Ph.D. thesis. It was not greeted with enthusiasm, for chemists had assumed for a century that atoms were featureless, indestructible, and unchanging. The thought of atoms carrying electric charges lent them features and a structure, and that was hard to accept. However, Arrhenius's theory made sense in every other way, so he was given a passing grade—but the lowest possible one. In 1903, when key discoveries had been made concerning the atom’s structure, this same thesis obtained for Arrhenius a Nobel Prize. 		
sugar-structure	1884	Sugar structure	The structure of sugars, including their three-dimensional atomic arrangement, was studied to explain their optical activity. It was found that sugars can exist in multiple varieties based on carbon bond arrangements, and they fall into two series, D and L, which are mirror images of each other.	Emil Hermann Fischer	Germany	tetrahedral-carbon-atom	Science: Chemistry	Though sugars had been studied throughout the nineteenth century, and though their atomic content was more or less known, the actual three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms was not known. The work of van’t Hoff, ten years before, had shown the importance of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the way this could be responsible for optical activity (see 1874).		
cocaine	1884	Cocaine	Cocaine, an alkaloid from coca leaves, was used for its pain-relieving properties and tested as a local anesthetic during an eye surgery. This led to developments in safer and more effective local anesthetics.	Karl Koller	Austria	anesthesia	Science: Medicine	Cocaine is an alkaloid obtained from the leaves of the coca bush, which originally grew wild in Peru and Bolivia. The Incas chewed the leaves to suppress feelings of pain and weariness and so be able to endure the strains of life better. Europeans eventually discovered cocaine without understanding at first that it was strongly addictive and therefore dangerous. One of the first to study it was an Austrian physician, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). He did not follow it up but passed on his information to an Austrian colleague, Karl Koller (1857–1944). Freud suggested that cocaine might be a pain-relieving agent, but Koller went further and studied its uses as a local anesthetic (one that would deaden pain in a particular area of the body without producing unconsciousness). In 1884, after having experimented on animals, Koller performed an eye operation on a patient—the first using local anesthesia. It was successful. Eventually, local anesthetics were developed that were more effective, and safer, than cocaine.		
bacterial-staining	1884	Bacterial staining	Bacterial staining involves using synthetic dyes to differentiate types of bacteria as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative. This method became crucial in developing effective antibacterial treatments.	Hans Christian Joachim Gram	Denmark	chromatin	Science: Biology	Bacteria can be stained with synthetic dyes, just as Flemming had shown that ordinary cells can be. In 1884 a Danish bacteriologist, Hans Christian Joachim Gram (1853-1938), stained bacteria with a dye. He found that, when treated with iodine and an alcohol wash, the stain could be removed from some kinds of bacteria but not from others. The bacteria that retained the dye were called Gram-positive, while those that lost it were Gram-negative. The importance of this became apparent once antibacterial agents were developed and it was found that some attacked the Gram-positive varieties and some the Gram-negative ones.		
steam-turbine	1884	Steam turbine	The steam turbine, designed to withstand high temperatures and rapid rotation, revolutionized ship propulsion and electric power generation. This invention led to significant advancements in marine and electrical engineering.	Charles Algernon Parsons	England	turbines	Science: Engineering	Turbines had been devised (see 1827), but none were capable of withstanding the high temperatures to which they would be subjected if they were to be turned by jets of steam and of withstanding the simultaneous stress of rapid rotation while preventing steam from escaping prematurely. In 1884, however, the British engineer Charles Algernon Parsons (1854-1931) constructed the first successful steam turbine. Such devices could be used to power ships, which could then attain unusually high speeds. They could also be used in electric generators.		
linotype	1884	Linotype	The Linotype machine allowed operators to set whole lines of type simultaneously by using a keyboard, significantly speeding up the printing process. This invention became a cornerstone of publishing, particularly for newspapers, for over seventy-five years.	Ottmar Mergenthaler	United States	printing-press, typewriters	General	In 1884 a German-born American inventor, Ottmar Mergenthaler (1854-1899), patented a machine that, when directed by an operator at a keyboard, could set a whole line of type at one time. It was therefore called a Linotype machine. For the next three-quarters of a century it was a mainstay of publishing—especially newspapers, which increasingly had to be turned out steadily and in quantity.		
fountain-pen	1884	Fountain pen	The fountain pen allowed for extended writing periods without frequent ink dips thanks to its built-in reservoir. This advancement replaced the dip pen and became widely used for writing.	Lewis Edson Waterman	United States	writing	General	In 1884 an American inventor, Lewis Edson Waterman (1837-1901), patented a pen with a reservoir that could be filled with ink. The pen could then write for a long time before another filling was called for. The reservoir held a virtual fountain of ink, and before long the fountain pen, with further improvements, had replaced the dip pen almost everywhere. Even the typewriter (see 1867) did not completely remove the need for writing, after all.		
rabies	1885	Rabies	An attenuated preparation was developed to prevent rabies, granting immunity without causing disease. This treatment successfully saved a boy bitten by a mad dog.	Louis Pasteur	France	anthrax-inoculation	Science: Medicine	Pasteur tried to treat the disease as he had treated anthrax (see 1881), by developing an attenuated and feeble preparation of the causative agent that would give immunity but not the disease. He showed that an attenuated agent could be obtained by passing a rabies infection through a variety of different species of animals until its virulence had abated. In 1885 Pasteur made the first use of his attenuated preparation to prevent a case of rabies in a boy, Joseph Meister (1878-1940), who had been bitten by a mad dog. The treatment worked, and the boy was saved.		
purines-and-pyrimidines	1885	Purines and pyrimidines	The molecular structure of nucleic acids was explored by isolating purines and pyrimidines. Two different purines, adenine (A) and guanine (G) and three different pyramidines, uracil (U), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)	Albrecht Kossel	Germany	nucleic-acid, sugar-structure	Science: Biochemistry	Since the nucleic acids had been discovered by Miescher (see 1869), little had been done to determine their molecular structure. Then the German biochemist Albrecht Kossel (1853–1927) took up the matter. He got rid of the proteins associated with the nucleic acids and worked on the material itself. By 1885 he had obtained substances from it that included the double-ring purines Emil Fischer had studied a few years earlier (see 1884). He also obtained pyrimidines, whose molecules were made up of a single ring of atoms, four carbons and two nitrogens. He isolated two different pyrimidine bases, thymine and cytosine.		
praseodymium-and-neodymium	1885	Praseodymium and neodymium	Didymium was found to be a mixture of two rare earth elements, which were separated and named praseodymium and neodymium. This discovery allowed for further scientific understanding and advancements in the study of rare earth elements.	Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach	Austria	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	Didymium was a rare earth element that had been discovered by Mosander some forty years before. Its name is derived from the Greek word for "twin" because it was so like other rare earth elements. However, the name turned out to be more apt than was thought, for the element was actually twins, a mixture of two very similar elements. In 1885, after much careful work, an Austrian chemist, Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach, managed to separate the two elements. One he named praseodymium ("green twin," because of the color of a prominent line in its spectrum) and the other he named neodymium (new twin).		
welsbach-mantle	1885	Welsbach mantle	The Welsbach mantle enhanced gas flame brightness by heating a fabric impregnated with thorium and cerium nitrate, making kerosene lamps competitive with electric lighting. This innovation extended the utility of kerosene lamps for an additional three decades.	Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach	Austria	cerium-osmium-iridium, thorium, kerosene	Science: Chemistry	Von Welsbach was the first to find an important use for the rare earth elements in which he was so interested. It occurred to him that gas flames might be made to give more light if they were allowed to heat up some compound that would itself then glow brightly. He tried many substances that would glow at high heat without melting and finally found that if he impregnated a cylindrical fabric with thorium nitrate, to which a small amount of cerium nitrate (a compound of one of the rare earth elements) had been added, he would obtain a brilliant white glow in a gas flame. This Welsbach mantle, when used in a kerosene lamp, gave such a bright light that it allowed kerosene lamps to compete with electric light for another thirty years or so.		
transformer	1885	Transformer	The transformer, invented to shift voltage and amperage, enabled the efficient transmission of alternating current over long distances, while minimizing energy loss. This invention solidified the victory of alternating current over direct current.	William Stanley	United States	alternating-currents	Science: Physics	In the battle between alternating current and direct current (see 1883), victory went to alternating current, because it could be transformed into another current of much higher voltage and of correspondingly lower amperage (to get something, you have to give up something in the real world). While it is in this high-voltage state, the current can be transported long distances with comparatively little loss. Once it arrives at its destination, it can be reconverted into a low-voltage, high-amperage current again, in which form it can do its work best. For these transformations from low to high voltage and back again, a device was needed that was invented in 1885 by an American electrical engineer, William Stanley, who was working for Westinghouse. His transformer could shift voltage and amperage, but only with alternating current and not with direct current.		
first-automobile	1885	First automobile	Benz's first automobile was a three-wheeler powered by a single-cylinder gasoline engine with a chain-driven back axle. It had a speed of 8 miles per hour and used a steering tiller with rear wheels featuring carriage-type leaf springs.	Carl Friedrich Benz	Germany	steam-locomotive, four-stroke-engine, carriage-springs	Design	Benz’s first automobile of 1885, shown here with the rear cover removed, was a three-wheeler powered by a light-weight, single-cylinder gasoline engine which drove the back axle by means of a chain. A large horizontal flywheel evened out the irregularities of the slow-running 1-horsepower engine. The engine had (unreliable) electric ignition, using a spark plug supplied by a battery and an induction coil, and the vehicle chugged along at eight miles an hour. The smaller front wheel was steered using a tiller, and only the spindly rear wheels had any springing, which was in the form of carriage-type leaf springs. The car has survived, and can still be seen at a museum in Munich. Later automobiles had wooden-spoked wheels, although tiller steering remained standard for many years.		
fingerprints	1885	Fingerprints	The uniqueness of fingerprints was highlighted, establishing that no two people, except identical twins, have the same fingerprints. This laid the foundation for using fingerprints in personal identification, adding a new dimension to forensic medicine.	Francis Galton 	England	illustrated-anatomy	Science: Biology	In 1885 Galton pointed out the individuality of fingerprints. No two people (barring identical twins) had identical fingerprints, and Galton		
aluminum-process	1886	Aluminum process	Aluminum is a common element that was difficult to isolate and used to be considered precious. A new method called the Hall-Héroult process was developed independently by two individuals, making aluminum cheaper and ideal for various uses like aircraft.	Hall and Héroult	United States and France	aluminum, sodium-and-potassium	Science: Chemistry	Aluminum is the most common element in the Earth's crust. It was first isolated by Ørsted (see 1825), but the isolation was so difficult that it was virtually a precious metal. Napoleon III had his cutlery and a baby rattle for the Prince Imperial made out of aluminum, and the capstone on the Washington Monument is a slab of aluminum.In 1886 an American student of chemistry, Charles Martin Hall (1863–1914), heard his teacher say that anyone who discovered a cheap way of making aluminum would grow rich and famous. In his home laboratory, using homemade batteries, Hall devised a method of preparing aluminum by the use of an electric current, as Davy had prepared sodium and potassium nearly eighty years before (see 1807). He used aluminum oxide dissolved in a molten mineral named cryolite, and into it he stuck carbon electrodes.  Oddly enough, that same year a French metallurgist, Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult (1863–1914), with the same last initial and the same birth and death years, independently devised precisely the same system, which is therefore called the Hall-Héroult process.  Aluminum became cheaper almost at once, and it is now second only to steel as a structural material. A combination of lightness and strength makes it ideal for aircraft, for instance.		
germanium	1886	Germanium	Germanium is an element discovered by analyzing a silver ore, which filled the gap predicted by Mendeleyev as eka-silicon. Its properties matched those predicted, validating Mendeleyev's periodic table.	Clemens Alexander Winkler	Germany	periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Chemistry	A German chemist, Clemens Alexander Winkler (1838–1904), analyzed a silver ore and, when he had completed his work, found that the elements he had located added up to only 93 percent of the whole. Puzzled, he searched out the remaining 7 percent and, in 1886, found a hitherto unrecognized element, which he named germanium, after Germany. It turned out to be eka-silicon and filled the one remaining gap for which Mendeleyev had predicted a new element (see 1869). What's more, the properties matched. 		
fluorine	1886	Fluorine	Chemists had long theorized the existence of an element named fluorine, but it was more reactive than oxygen thus very hard to isolate. Using platinum equipment, fluorine was successfully isolated, leading to significant advancements in chemistry.	Henri Moissan	France	malleable-platinum, chlorine	Science: Chemistry	For three-quarters of a century, chemists had known that a certain element must exist. They had even given it a name—fluorine. However, it was a particularly active element, the most active one known, more active than oxygen and chlorine, and nothing seemed capable of forcing it out of combination with other elements. A number of chemists tried to isolate it and found the matter not only difficult but dangerous, for the materials they had to work with were poisonous. Finally, a French chemist, Henri Moissan (1852-1907), tried. He used platinum for all his equipment, because it was one of the very few substances that fluorine would not attack and combine with instantly. If he isolated some fluorine in platinum, that fluorine would stay isolated. He placed a solution of potassium fluoride in hydrogen fluoride in his platinum equipment, chilled it to -50°C to tame the fluorine a bit, and passed an electric current through it on June 26, 1886. He obtained a pale yellow gas that was the long-sought fluorine.		
dysprosium	1886	Dysprosium	While working with rare earth ores, a new element called dysprosium (Greek "hard to get at") was discovered. This advanced the understanding and classification of rare earth elements.	Lecoq de Boisbaudran	France	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who had already isolated gallium (see 1874) and samarium (see 1879), was working on a rare earth ore containing holmium when he discovered that it contained a small amount of still another rare earth element, which he named dysprosium, from a Greek word meaning 'hard to get at.'		
canal-rays	1886	Canal rays	Canal rays were discovered using a perforated cathode, revealing radiation that streamed in the opposite direction. This finding contributed to the understanding of particle physics and radiation.	Eugen Goldstein	Germany	charged-cathode-rays	Science: Physics	Goldstein, who had given cathode rays their name (see 1876), continued to work with them. In 1886 he used a perforated cathode, one with small holes, or channels, penetrating it. When he did this, he found that not only did cathode rays emerge as usual, but radiation passed through the channels and streamed in the opposite direction. He called the radiation Kanalstrahlen, which is German for 'channel rays,' but they were usually called canal rays, by the same mistranslation that had given rise to the notion of Martian canals (see 1877).		
raoults-law	1886	Raoult's law	Raoult's Law demonstrates that the partial pressure of solvent vapors is proportional to the number of solvent molecules to solute molecules in a solution. This law aids in calculating molecular weights and understanding the effects on boiling and freezing points.	François-Marie Raoult	France	ionic-dissociation	Science: Chemistry	The French physical chemist François-Marie Raoult (1830–1901) showed in 1886 that the partial pressure of solvent vapors in equilibrium with a solution is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of solvent molecules to solute molecules. This is called Raoult's law. To the nonchemist, the law may seem unclear, but it provided chemists with a new way of calculating the molecular weight of dissolved substances. It also showed that the freezing point was depressed, and the boiling point elevated, in proportion to the number of particles present in a given volume of solution. Arrhenius had assumed this when he had worked out his theory of ionic dissociation two years earlier (see 1884).		
nitrogen-fixation	1886	Nitrogen fixation	Plants require nitrogen for growth and absorb it from nitrates in the soil. It was discovered that leguminous plants have bacteria on their roots that fix nitrogen from the air into a usable form, aiding soil fertility.	Hermann Hellriegel	Germany	agriculture, bacteriology	Science: Biology	Plants must have nitrogen atoms to build their tissues, and they get them from nitrates in the soil. There are enormous amounts of nitrogen in the atmosphere, but nitrogen itself is not active, and it is not easy to force it into combination with other substances. The German chemist Hermann Hellriegel (1831-1895) discovered in 1886 that some leguminous plants (peas, beans, and related species) had root nodules that contained nitrogen-fixing bacteria (that is, bacteria that could affix nitrogen to other kinds of elements, eventually forming nitrates). Since there is always a danger that plants will consume the nitrates in soil, causing it to decline in fertility, it was useful to know that the planting of leguminous plants would restore the fertility of the soil—at least with respect to nitrogen. 		
michelson-morley-experiment	1887	Michelson-Morley experiment	An experiment aimed to detect the Earth's motion through the ether yielded no results, challenging existing scientific theories. This 'failure' became a pivotal point in the development of modern physics.	Michelson and Morley	United States	interferometer	Science: Physics	Michelson, who had hoped to determine the Earth’s speed of motion through the stationary ether (see 1881), continued to improve the delicacy of his procedure and of his instruments, and to repeat the experiment. Finally, in 1887, with the help of a colleague, the American chemist Edward Williams Morley (1838-1923), Michelson ran a definitive experiment and, once again, found no interference fringes. There had to be an explanation. Either the Earth was motionless with respect to the ether, or the Earth dragged the ether with it, or something. All possible explanations seemed highly unlikely, and for nearly a quarter of a century, the world of science was completely puzzled. It took a scientific revolution to explain the matter, so that the Michelson-Morley experiment is perhaps the most important “failure” in the history of science.		
photoelectric-effect	1887	Photoelectric effect	Hertz set up an electrical circuit that oscillated between two metal balls separated by an air gap, sending a spark across the gap whenever potential reached a peak. Hertz noted that when UV light shone on the negative terminal, the balls sparked more readily. This was the first observation of the photoelectric effect.	Heinrich Rudolph Hertz	Germany	maxwells-equations	Science: Physics	The German physicist Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857-1894) was interested in Maxwell’s equations (see 1865). As part of his investigation of electromagnetic effects in the light of those equations, he set up an electrical circuit that oscil-		
mach-number	1887	Mach number	As technology advanced so did the sped with which humans could move. Mach studied the relationship between speed of an object and the speed of sound through air, identifying critical changes in air resistance. It led to important advancements in aerodynamics and high-speed travel.	Ernst Mach	Austria	steam-locomotive-improved, aerodynamics	Science: Physics	With advancing technology, human beings were traveling faster than they had in the past, and they were likely to travel faster still in the future. The faster human beings traveled, the more important air resistance would be. The Austrian physicist Ernst Mach (1838–1916) studied the conditions that occurred when a solid object and air were in rapid motion relative to each other. The natural rate at which air molecules can move is the speed of sound through air. When an object moves through air at higher speeds, the air molecules can no longer move aside naturally but must be shoved aside (so to speak) faster than they want to go. This produces new conditions, which Mach studied.		
rubber-tire	1887	Rubber tire	The invention of the rubber tire, particularly the pneumatic version, significantly improved wheeled transportation by providing better durability and shock absorption. It led to major advancements in the design and comfort of vehicles.	John Boyd Dunlop	England	vulcanization-of-rubber, cart	Design	Since wheeled transportation had been invented five thousand years before, wheels had wooden or metal rims. These were noisy and offered no spring, so that travel on carts and wagons was a jolting affair. In 1887 a British inventor, John Boyd Dunlop (1840–1921), decided to rim the wheels of his son’s tricycle with a rubber tire (and patented the notion the following year). Rubber, though soft, actually wears better than wood or iron does. What’s more, Dunlop made it a pneumatic tire: what went round the rim was an air-filled tube, which was covered by a tire with a rubber tread. This gave a vehicle spring and cut down the noise tremendously, so that tires were soon used for automobiles and other vehicles as well.		
radio-waves	1888	Radio waves	Long-wave electromagnetic radiation, or radio waves, were discovered by Hertz with the help of a simple detector coil. This validated Maxwell's equations and expanded the known electromagnetic spectrum to include wavelengths far longer than visible light.	Heinrich Rudolph Hertz	Germany	photoelectric-effect	Science: Physics	When Hertz was performing the experiments that gave him the first glimpse of a photoelectric effect (see 1887), he expected that the oscillating current he was working with would produce an electromagnetic wave. Each oscillation should produce a wave, and the wave should be very long. After all, since light that travels a bit over 186,000 miles per second, a wavelength formed in an oscillation of a mere hundred-thousandth of a second will still be nearly 2 miles long. In 1888, he actually observed such waves. Hertz used, as a device for detecting the possible presence of such long-wave radiation, a simple loop of wire, with a small air gap at one point. Just as the current in his first coil gave rise to radiation, so the radiation produced ought to give rise to a current in the second coil. Sure enough, Hertz was able to detect small sparks jumping across the gap in his detector coil.  By moving his detector coil to various parts of the room, Hertz could tell the shape of the waves by the intensity of the spark formation and could calculate a wavelength of 2.2 feet. This is a million times the size of a wavelength of ordinary light. He also managed to show that the waves were electromagnetic in nature. At first these long-wave radiations were called Hertzian waves, but later the name radio waves came into use instead. In this way, Hertz verified the usefulness of Maxwell's equations and showed that light was only a tiny section of the electromagnetic spectrum. 		
le-chateliers-principle	1888	Le Châtelier's principle	Le Châtelier's principle describes how systems in equilibrium respond to changes in environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature. It explains that systems will adjust in a way that counteracts or minimizes the imposed change.	Henri-Louis Le Châtelier	France	law-of-mass-action, chemical-thermodynamics	Science: Chemistry	The French chemist Henri-Louis Le Châtelier (1850–1936) stated a rule in 1888 that became known as Le Châtelier’s principle. The rule is this: Every change in one of the factors of an equilibrium brings about a rearrangement of the system in such a direction as to minimize the original change. If a system in equilibrium is placed under increased pressure, for instance, the system rearranges itself to take up less room, so as to minimize the increased pressure. Again, if the temperature is raised, the system undergoes a change that absorbs some of the additional heat, so as to minimize the rise in temperature.		
chromosome	1888	Chromosome	Chromosomes are the stubby threads of chromatin that appear during cell division. The term became widely known in the scientific community and to the general public.	Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz	Germany	chromatin	Science: Biology	In 1888 the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz (1836-1921) suggested that the stubby threads of chromatin that appeared during cell division be called chromosomes. This has become one of those scientific terms that is well known to the public at large.		
greenland-ice-cap	1888	Greenland ice cap	Fridtjof Nansen successfully crossed Greenland, demonstrating it was covered by a significant ice cap. That one ice cap is now known to contain ~8% of all the ice in the world.	Fridtjof Nansen	Norway	greenland	Geography	In 1888 the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930) landed on the eastern shore of Greenland with five others. All six managed to cross to the inhabited western shore in a six-week trek. It was the first time Greenland had ever been crossed. The crossing seemed to indicate that the entire interior of Greenland was buried under a huge ice cap, a last remnant of the Ice Age. That one ice cap is now known to contain about 8 percent of all the ice in the world.		
home-photography	1888	Home photography	George Eastman introduced a simplified camera and flexible film system called Kodak, making photography accessible to everyone. The innovation led to widespread use of cameras in homes.	George Eastman	United States	photographic-negative, dry-plates	Design	The American inventor George Eastman (1854-1932) simplified the process. He substituted a flexible film for the large and inflexible piece of glass on which photographic emulsion was spread and dried. With a film that could be rolled compactly, cameras could be made much smaller. In 1888 Eastman developed a camera that weighed only about 2 pounds. He called it the Kodak, a meaningless name but one Eastman thought would be catchy and easily remembered. It had the film rolled up in it, and all the owner had to do was to point the camera, press a button, then send the camera to Rochester. Eventually, the photograph and the newly loaded camera were sent back. The Kodak slogan was “You press the button—we do the rest.” There were many improvements to come, but the Kodak started the process that allowed anyone and everyone to take photographs. The camera entered the home and began to make itself universal.		
neuron-theory	1889	Neuron theory	Neuron theory posits that the nervous system is built out of separate cells called neurons, which remain distinct from each other nearly touching one another. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal used staining techniques that worked out the cellular structure of the brain and spinal cord in detail, firmly establishing this theory.	Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal	Italy and Spain	chromatin	Science: Biology	Of all the cells, the nerve cells seem most complex, and of all the organs and systems of organs, the brain and nervous system seem most complex. Moreover, of all the parts of a human body, the brain and nervous system are, or should be, the most interesting, since it is they that make us human. Waldeyer-Hartz (see 1888) was the first to maintain that the nervous system was built out of separate cells and their delicate extensions. The delicate extensions, he pointed out, approached each other closely but did not actually meet, much less join, so that the nerve cells remained separate. He called the nerve cells neurons, and his thesis that the nervous system is composed of separate neurons is the neuron theory. An Italian histologist, Camillo Golgi (1843 or 1844–1926), fifteen years before, had devised a system of staining with silver compounds that brought out the structure of neurons in fine detail. Using this stain he could demonstrate that Waldeyer-Hartz’s views were correct. He could show that fine processes did indeed issue from the neurons and that those from one neuron approached but did not touch those of neighboring neurons. The tiny gaps between one neuron and the next are called synapses (oddly enough, from a Greek word meaning “union,” which they appeared to be at a casual glance but were not in actuality). A Spanish histologist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934), improved on Golgi’s stain, and by 1889 had worked out the cellular structure of the brain and spinal cord in detail, firmly establishing the neuron theory. For their work on the neuron theory, Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1906.		
tetanus	1889	Tetanus	The modernization efforts in Japan allowed scholars to adapt and excel in Western scientific practices, exemplified by advancements in understanding diseases like tetanus. Japanese researchers bridged cultural gaps in scientific knowledge.	Shibasaburo Kitao	Japan	bacteriology	Science: Biology	The modernization of Japan included an orientation of Japanese scholars toward western science, for which they showed a ready aptitude. (This is true of scholars in all nations. There is no such thing as “western” science in the sense that it can only come out of western minds.) Thus, a Japanese bacteriologist, Shibasaburo Kita-		
axiomatics	1889	Axiomatics	Inspired by redefinitions of Euclidian geometry, Peano used symbolic logic to define natural numbers, beginning with formally defined concepts of zero, number, and successor, and developing it up to algebra.	Giuseppe Peano	Italy	non-euclidean-geometry, symbolic-logic	Math	The work of Lobachevsky and others in non-Euclidean geometry (see 1826) had highlighted the importance of choosing different systems of axioms to develop different types of geometry. The work of Boole on symbolic logic (see 1847) seemed to offer a tool for testing the necessary axioms of mathematics generally. In 1889 an Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), published A Logical Exposition of the Principles of Geometry.		
energy-of-activation	1889	Energy of activation	The energy of activation concept explained why certain reactions require an initial energy input to start. This understanding led to insights into chemical reactions and chain reactions.	Svante August Arrhenius	Sweden	chemical-thermodynamics	Science: Chemistry	It was the experience of early humans that fires were hard to start but that once started, they kept right on going with no further trouble as long as they were fed fuel. This is also true of many chemical reactions. Nevertheless, a reaction that ordinarily yields energy when it proceeds will not take place spontaneously until energy is added to it. The reaction has to be activated, by breaking molecules apart, perhaps, so that individual atoms or molecular fragments can react with each other more freely. The energy required is called the energy of activation. Once the reaction starts, it yields energy that can be used to activate neighboring parts of the initial substance. Thus, when you heat a hydrogen and oxygen mixture and a small amount begins to react, the energy it produces will cause a wave of reaction to spread to other parts of the mixture so rapidly that it explodes. This is a chain reaction, since each step leads to the next, as each link in a chain leads to the next. Arrhenius (see 1884) analyzed the energy activation concept systematically in 1889 and brought about new understanding of chemical reactions, of chain reactions, and of explosions.		
spectroscopic-binaries	1889	Spectroscopic binaries	Spectroscopic binaries are binary stars that are too close to be observed as separate stars through a telescope. They were identified by their spectral lines shifting due to their motion relative to Earth.	Pickering and Vogel	United States and Germany	binary-stars, constitution-of-the-stars	Space	Binary stars had been known since Herschel had discovered them nearly a century before (see 1781). However, they could be detected optically only if they were far enough apart to be seen as separate objects in a telescope. What if the pair were so far away or so close together (or both) that they could not be distinguished? In 1889 the American astronomer Edward Charles Pickering (1846–1919) noted that Mizar, the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper, had dark lines that divided in two. They moved apart, then came together, joined, and moved apart again in the opposite direction. He suspected that what he was viewing was a binary star with components so close together they could not be seen separately. However, as they circled each other in the plane of his line of sight, one was advancing and the other receding, so that the former showed a violet shift and the latter a red shift. After they had swung about each other, the one that was receding began to advance and vice versa. His assistant, Antonia Caetana Maury (1866–1952), worked out the period of this spectroscopic binary—104 days—and then went on to discover a second such star, Beta Aurigae, with a period of 4 days. The following year, a German astronomer, Hermann Karl Vogel (1842–1907), independently discovered spectroscopic binaries.		
mercurys-rotation	1889	Mercury's rotation	The rotation of Mercury was studied using its surface markings, and Schiaparelli found some, which he always saw in the same position. He concluded that Mercury always presented the same side to the sun, which was consistent with the Sun's tidal influences to produce this effect.	Giovanni Schiaparelli	Italy	martian-canals	Space	Schiaparelli, who had been the first to see the markings on Mars that were interpreted as canals (see 1877), went on to study the markings on Mercury. Mercury was a smaller world than Mars and farther away. It was often lost in the Sun’s glare, and when it could be seen best, only a crescent		
cordite	1889	Cordite	Cordite is a smokeless explosive substance made from a mix of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. It allowed clearer views on battlefields and marked an advance over traditional gunpowder.	Frederick Augustus Abel, James Dewar	England	nitroglycerine, cellulose	War	For four centuries, gunpowder had ruled the battlefield. It produced a smoke and a stench, however, and battlefields hidden under a thickening pall of gunpowder smoke made adequate generalship difficult. An English chemist, Frederick Augustus Abel (1827-1902), worked on the problem of developing explosives that would not produce smoke. In 1889, with the help of another British chemist, James Dewar (1842-1923), he developed cordite.		
motion-pictures	1889	Motion pictures	Motion pictures simulate motion by displaying images in quick succession. Edison invented a method to extend such illusions in time by using a strip of film with perforations which would be moved by sprocket wheels and a flashing light at a carefully regulated speed.	Thomas Edison	United States	home-photography	Design	Once photography had been invented (see 1839), it seemed natural to use it to simulate motion. If photographs are taken of a moving object in quick succession and flashed before the eyes rapidly, the eye retains an image of each for a brief while, so that all the flashings melt together and are not seen as separate images. Instead, the object photographed seems to move. Such devices were constructed, but generally they showed very brief movements that might be repeated over and over again. Primitive as such devices were, they amused the audience. Edison thought of a way to extend such illusions and perpetuate them for a considerable length of time. He used a strip of film, of the type brought into production by Eastman (see 1888), and took a series of closely spaced photographs of a moving object, which he placed along its length. The film could then be moved by means of perforations along the sides over sprocket wheels, which could push the film in front of a flashing light at a carefully regulated speed. In effect, Edison had invented motion pictures. With a steady stream of improvements, they developed into a giant industry as indispensable to modern life as the automobile.		
antitoxin	1890	Antitoxin	A microorganism sometimes produces a substance which causes a disease (a toxin). Behring successfully produced immunity against tetanus by injecting small doses of blood serum from another animal suffering tetanus. This also worked for diphteria, a common and fatal children's disease.	Emil Adolf von Behring	Germany	diphtheria, tetanus	Science: Medicine	A microorganism itself may not be the immediate cause of a disease, but some substance it produces may be (a toxin, from a Greek word for “poison”). An organism stricken with the disease then produces a substance (an antitoxin) capable of neutralizing the toxin. If the organism recovers, the antitoxin present in its bloodstream confers immunity to the disease thereafter.A German bacteriologist, Emil Adolf von Behring (1854–1917), decided in 1890 that it might be possible to produce an immunity against tetanus, in an animal, by injecting into it graded doses of blood serum from another animal suffering from tetanus. Enough of the serum would be given to induce antitoxin formation, but not enough to cause it to die. It was found that the animal thus immunized could then be used as a source of antitoxin that could confer at least temporary immunity on still another animal, or in a human being. Behring tried this also in the case of diphtheria, a disease that was in those days common among children and often fatal. The diphtheria antitoxin, once marketed, not only conferred a certain immunity, but helped defeat the disease even after it had established itself. For this work, Behring received the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1901, the first year in which Nobel Prizes were awarded.		
java-man	1890	Java man	Skeletal remains of an early human ancestor, Java Man, was found. These hominids were believed to be more primitive than Neanderthals and are now called Homo Erectus. This discovery added significant knowledge about human evolution.	Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois	Netherlands	neanderthal-man	Science: Paleontology	The skeletal remains of Neanderthal man had been uncovered thirty-four years earlier (see 1856), but although the Neanderthals possessed some primitive features, they had brains as large as our own. A truly primitive human ancestor had not yet been discovered.By this time, though, the anthropoid apes were well known, and a Dutch paleontologist, Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (1858–1941), believed that primitive human beings would be found where the anthropoid apes now were: in sections of Africa and southeast Asia. He could not easily reach Africa, but the Indonesian islands were Dutch territory, and Dubois, who was serving in the army, managed		
spectroheliograph	1890	Spectroheliograph	The spectroheliograph was invented to photograph the Sun's spectrum in a small band of wavelengths, aiding in detailed study of its outer chemistry. It enabled the examination of specific wavelengths like calcium.	George Ellery Hale	United States	stellar-photography	Space	In 1890, American astronomer George Ellery Hale invented the spectroheliograph, a device allowing the photography of the Sun's light spectrum, especially calcium wavelengths. This innovation made it possible to study the Sun's outer chemistry in detail.		
surgical-gloves	1890	Surgical gloves	Rubber gloves were introduced in surgery to prevent infections and improve hygiene. These could be more easily sterilized than human hands without cutting down on the hand's ability to touch. This innovation marked the transition from antiseptic (killing germs) to aseptic (no germs at all) surgical techniques.	William Stewart Halsted	United States	antiseptic-surgery	Science: Medicine	In 1890, American surgeon William Stewart Halsted introduced the use of rubber gloves in surgery to prevent infections and dermatitis, marking the shift from antiseptic to aseptic surgery, a major advance in surgical practices.		
asteroid-photography	1891	Asteroid photography	Asteroid photography involves using a telescope to capture images of asteroids as the earth turns. This method allowed for more precise calculation of asteroid orbits and helped Halsted discover the 323rd known asteroid and then 500 more in his life.	Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf	Germany	asteroids, stellar-photography	Space	It had been almost a century now since the first asteroid was discovered by Piazzi (see 1802), and others had been discovered in astonishing numbers. By 1891, 322 asteroids had been discovered and their orbits calculated. Each one, however, had been discovered by eye; an object would be seen that looked like a rather dim star but would be shifting position against the starry background. If it moved at a certain rate, it was almost certainly an asteroid. In 1891 it occurred to a German astronomer, Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf (1863-1932), to make the discoveries by photography. If a telescope is set to turning in time with the movement of the vault of the sky (a movement that arises because of the rotational motion of the Earth), then all the stars in the telescopic view will show up on the film as sharp points. An asteroid, however, will move with respect to the stars and so will show up as a small dash. The object responsible for the dash can then be put under observation and its orbit eventually calculated. In this fashion, Wolf discovered the 323rd asteroid, which he named Brucia, and went on to discover others. In the course of his life, he discovered 500 asteroids. Nowadays, the orbits of nearly 2000 asteroids are known, and it is estimated that there may be as many as 100,000 asteroids that are at least a mile across.		
gravitational-and-inertial-mass	1890	Gravitational and inertial mass	Gravitational mass relates to the intensity of an object’s gravitational field required for a given distance, whereas inertial mass is defined by the resistance to change in velocity. Through careful measurements, these two kinds of mass were found to be identical. This led to a new way of looking at gravity.	Roland Eötvös	Hungary	laws-motion	Science: Physics	Newton had defined mass in terms of the amount of acceleration produced in a body through the application of a force of a given magnitude. This is called the inertial mass, because the greater the mass of a body, the less acceleration a given force produces and the greater the inertia (the resistance to a change in velocity). Newton also found that the intensity of an object’s gravitational field at a given distance depended upon its mass. That is the gravitational mass. These two kinds of mass were determined by two entirely different kinds of observations and would seem to have no necessary connection, yet the mass determined by inertial effects always seemed to be the same as the mass determined by gravitational effects. A Hungarian physicist, Roland Eötvös (1848-1919), saw that if the gravitational mass and the inertial mass were truly identical, then objects in a given gravitational field would always drop (in a vacuum) at the same rate, regardless of mass.		
fundamental-unit-of-electricity	1891	Fundamental unit of electricity	The theory proposed that electricity exists in fundamental particles called electrons, which carry electric charges. This theory had yet to be proven.	George Johnstone Stoney	Ireland	ionic-dissociation	Science: Physics	Arrhenius's theory of ionic dissociation (see 1884) made it look as though atoms or groups of atoms could carry electric charges. What's more, it looked as though atoms or atom groups would carry charges of different sizes that were related to each other in ratios of exact whole numbers. An Irish physicist, George Johnstone Stoney (1826-1911), suggested that electricity existed in fundamental particles, as matter did, and that all these particles carried the same electric charge. A particular atom or atom group would then carry one of these particles, or two or three, and that was why the ratios would be in whole numbers. He suggested in 1891 that the fundamental particle be called an 'electron'. This didn't seem to make much of an impression at the time, but four years later it was to come into its own.		
carborundum	1891	Carborundum	Carborundum (or silicon carbide) is a compound of silicon and carbon created by heating carbon strongly with clay. It proved to be a harder material than anything else at the time and became very useful in industry as an abrasive.	Edward Goodrich Acheson	United States	diamond	Science: Chemistry	People from the earliest times have needed abrasives; that is, hard substances that can grind down softer substances, removing unevenness and imparting a smooth polish to the surface. The diamond is made up of carbon atoms symmetrically placed in tetrahedral patterns, and they are very close to each other as well since the carbon atoms are so small. Therefore, the atoms in diamonds cling together more tightly than in any other substance, so that diamond is by far the hardest material known. Perfect diamonds are too beautiful to use for anything other than show and ornamentation, but imperfect diamonds, or diamond dust, can be used as abrasives. Even imperfect diamonds, however, are in short supply. Graphite is also made of carbon atoms, but in a different, looser arrangement. It is so far from being an abrasive that it can be used as a lubricant. By Le Châtelier's principle (see 1888), however, if graphite is placed under great pressure, its atoms should take up a more compact arrangement and it should become diamond (as it does under great pressure deep underground). Various scientists had tried to supply the necessary pressure, but up to this time none had succeeded. An American inventor, Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856-1931), made the attempt too. He did not succeed in forming diamond either, but in 1891, he found that when he heated carbon strongly with clay, he obtained what he eventually found to be a compound of silicon and carbon, or silicon carbide. Silicon is much like carbon in its properties, so that the atoms of silicon carbide have a diamond arrangement with a silicon atom taking the place of every other carbon. Silicon is a larger atom and doesn't hold together quite as tightly as carbon atoms do, so silicon carbide is not quite as hard as diamond. Still, it was harder than anything else known at the time, and much cheaper than diamond. Acheson called the new compound carborundum, and it became extremely useful in industry as an abrasive.		
glider-improved	1891	Improved gliders	The first human-carrying gliders were improved with curved wings, proving superior to flat wings for gliding. This advancement led to the increased popularity of gliding and paved the way for the invention of the airplane.	Otto Lilienthal	Germany	glider	General	Four decades had passed since Cayley had built the first glider capable of carrying a human being (see 1853). Now a German aeronautical engineer, Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896), made them into things of grace and ability. As early as 1877 he had shown that curved wings were superior to flat wings as far as gliding was concerned. In 1891 he launched himself on his first glide. He died a few years later in a crash landing, but he made gliding popular, and it turned out to be not too long a step from a glider to an airplane.		
amalthea	1892	Amalthea	A small satellite of Jupiter, named Amalthea, was discovered to be small close to the planet, analogous to the discoveries of Mars small moons. It was the last Jovian satellite identified without the use of photography.	Edward Emerson Barnard	United States	jupiter-moons, martian-satellites	Space	Galileo had discovered the four large satellites of Jupiter (see 1610). In the interval since, no other Jovian satellite had been discovered, even though Saturn, a smaller and more distant planet, was known to have eight satellites by this time. The American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard (1857–1923) reasoned, as Hall had in connection with Mars (see 1877), that a fifth satellite, if it existed, would have to be small and close to Jupiter. He searched the neighborhood of Jupiter and in 1892 spotted a satellite only 112,500 miles from Jupiter’s center and only 68,000 miles above Jupiter’s cloud surface. We now know it to be only 125 miles in diameter. It was variously called Barnard’s satellite and Jupiter V (because it was the fifth satellite to be discovered), but the French astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842–1925) suggested it be named Amalthea, after the goat (or nymph) that served as wet-nurse for Jupiter (Zeus) during the god’s infancy. Amalthea was the twenty-first satellite to be discovered and the last to be discovered without photography.		
light-pressure	1892	Light pressure	The pressure exerted by light, predicted by Maxwell’s equations, was measured using light mirrors in a vacuum. This discovery provided experimental evidence for the pressure of light.	Pyotr Nikolayevich Lebedev	Russia	maxwells-equations, geissler-tubes	Science: Physics	From Maxwell’s equations (see 1865) one could deduce that light ought to exert a pressure, albeit a very feeble one. The Russian physicist Pyotr Nikolayevich Lebedev (1866–1912) checked the point by making use of very light mirrors in a vacuum. In 1892 he was able to observe and measure the pressure exerted by light.		
fitzgerald-contraction	1892	Fitzgerald contraction	An explanation for the negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment was proposed, suggesting that distances contract with speed. This theory influenced the understanding of the behavior of light and motion but seemed unsatisfying.	George Francis FitzGerald	Ireland	michelson-morley-experiment	Science: Physics	For five years the negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment had puzzled physicists. The Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald (1851–1901) offered an explanation in 1892. He suggested that distances contracted with speed. If a light source sped along toward point A at a certain velocity, then the light it emitted in the direction of that velocity had to cover a slightly smaller distance to reach point A than light emitted in other directions. The faster the source moved, the shorter the distance light would have to travel to reach a point that would seem to be a fixed distance away to a motionless observer. That change in distance would keep the light moving in different directions in phase.		
dewar-flask	1892	Dewar flask	A double-walled flask with a vacuum between the walls was constructed to help transport heat for low-temperature work. It became commercially known as thermos bottles for keeping drinks hot or cold.	James Dewar	England	black-bodies	Science: Physics	Dewar (see 1889) in 1892 constructed a double-walled flask with a vacuum between the walls. He was interested in low-temperature work, and very cold liquids such as liquid nitrogen, if kept in such a double-walled flask, would gain heat from the outside only slowly. Dewar cut down on transport by radiation even more by covering the interior of the double walls with a mirror surface so that radiation would be reflected rather than absorbed. These were called Dewar flasks and proved indispensable to low-temperature work. They also entered the commercial home market, where they sold as thermos bottles for keeping cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot.		
psychoanalysis	1893	Psychoanalysis	Psychoanalysis involved using free association, allowing patients to talk randomly with minimal guidance, which helped reveal repressed matters. This method showed advantages over hypnotism in treating mental diseases.	Breuer and Freud	Austria	unconscious-mind, hypnotism	Science: Psychology	Breuer had started to use hypnotism in the treatment of mental diseases such as hysteria (see 1880). The method had later been taken up by Freud (see 1884), but he eventually abandoned hypnotism for free association, allowing the patient to talk randomly and at will with a minimum of guidance. In this fashion, the patient was gradually put off guard, and matters came to be revealed that in ordinary circumstances would have been kept secret from the patient's conscious mind. The advantage of this method over hypnotism		
cattle-fever	1893	Cattle fever	Texas cattle fever was identified as being caused by a protozoan parasite (just like malaria) and spread by blood-sucking ticks. This discovery provided the first clear evidence that arthropods could transmit diseases.	Theobald Smith	United States	malaria	Science: Biology	In 1893 the American pathologist Theobald Smith (1859-1934) reported that Texas cattle fever was caused by a protozoan parasite, as had been found to be true of malaria thirteen years before. Smith went on to show that the parasite was spread from infected animals to healthy ones by blood-sucking ticks. This was the first definite indication that disease could be spread by an arthropod. Ticks were among the arachnids (the spider family), but it would soon be shown that blood-sucking insects could also be responsible for the spread of disease.		
wavelengths-and-temperature	1893	Wavelengths and temperature	Wilhelm Wien demonstrated that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by an object varies inversely with its absolute temperature. This relationship helps explain the color changes in heated objects and contributes to our understanding of thermal radiation.	Wilhelm Wien	Germany	heat-and-radiation	Science: Physics	At any temperature above absolute zero, objects give off electromagnetic radiation. In general, very long wavelengths are rare, as are very short wavelengths. Somewhere in between there is a peak wavelength, which is radiated to a greater extent than any other. The German physicist Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928) demonstrated this by actually measuring the wavelengths. In 1893 he was able to show that the peak wavelength varies inversely with absolute temperature. As the temperature rises, not only does the total amount of radiation increase, in line with Stefan's finding (see 1879), but the peak wavelength decreases.  Thus, warm bodies radiate chiefly in the infrared, of which we are unaware except as a feeling of warmth. As temperature goes up, the peak slides toward the visible red, and eventually enough red is produced to give the body a deep red glow. It is then "red-hot." With further temperature rise, the red brightens, grows orange, yellowish, and then white, by which time the peak is in the yellow and all the wavelengths of light are well represented, as in the case of the Sun.  Some stars are so hot that the peak wavelength is in the ultraviolet. Such stars gleam with an intense blue-white light.  For his work on radiation, Wien received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1911.		
alternating-current-theory	1893	Alternating current theory	Developed the mathematical details essential for designing efficient alternating current equipment. His work facilitated the widespread adoption of alternating current over direct current in electrical systems.	Charles Proteus Steinmetz	United States	alternating-currents, imaginary-numbers	Science: Engineering	Tesla had made alternating current useful (see 1883). By 1893 a German-born American electrical engineer, Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865-1923), had worked out the intricacies of alternating current circuitry in complete mathematical detail, making use of complex numbers. This made it possible to design alternating current equipment with increased efficiency. Steinmetz's mathematics spread among the electrical engineering profession and completed the victory of alternating current over direct current. (The house current we draw on whenever we plug an electrical device into a wall socket is invariably alternating current.)		
arctic-ocean	1894	Arctic ocean	A strong ship named Fram was designed to withstand Arctic sea ice and carry explorers close to the North Pole. The expedition got closer to the Pole than anyone before.	Nansen	Norway	greenland-ice-cap, ironclad-warships	Geography	Nansen, who had crossed Greenland (see 1888), now made ready to explore the Arctic Ocean. He designed a strong ship that would be lifted, rather than crushed, when the ocean about it froze. He named the ship Fram (Forward) and set sail in 1893 with thirteen men aboard. His idea was to let himself be frozen in by the sea ice and carried along with it in its slow swirl about the Arctic Ocean, perhaps reaching the North Pole itself. He remained on the ship for a year and a half, and although he never reached the North Pole, he got closer to it (86.23 degrees North) than anyone before him ever had.		
argon	1894	Argon	The atomic weight of nitrogen was found to vary based on its source. To resolve this inconsistency Ramsay used the same technique Cavendish used to discovering hydrogen. The result was a verifiably new gas, proven through spectrometry. He called this new element argon ("inert" in Greek).	John William Strutt and William Ramsay	Scotland	spectral-lines-and-elements, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Chemistry	Ever since Prout had suggested that all atoms were built up of hydrogen atoms (see 1815), chemists had been checking the atomic weights of various elements with greater and greater accuracy. The fact that so many atomic weights were not multiples of hydrogen's seemed to disprove Prout's hypothesis. Twelve years before, for instance, the British physicist John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919), had shown that the atomic weight of oxygen, although usually considered to be 16 times the atomic weight of hydrogen, is actually 15.882 times the atomic weight of hydrogen. Rayleigh went on to measure the atomic weight of nitrogen and then encountered a puzzle. Whereas oxygen always had the same atomic weight no matter how it was prepared, nitrogen did not. Nitrogen prepared from the atmosphere consistently showed a slightly higher atomic weight than nitrogen prepared from a variety of nitrogen-containing compounds. Rayleigh could not find a suitable explanation for this and wrote a letter to the journal Nature, asking for suggestions. The British chemist William Ramsay (1852-1916) rose to the challenge. He remembered having read that Cavendish (see 1766) had tried to combine the nitrogen of air with oxygen and had found that a small bubble of gas remained behind, which would simply not combine with oxygen. Cavendish Ramsay repeated the experiment and found himself with a small bubble of gas left over. He studied the spectral lines it emitted and found them to be in positions that fitted no known element. This gaseous element made up about 1 percent of the atmosphere and was completely inert, not reacting with any substance. It was named argon, which means 'inert.		
x-rays	1895	X-rays	X-rays were discovered unintentionally while working with cathode-ray tubes, leading to the observation of radiation penetrating matter. The discovery spurred significant interest and further research on electromagnetic radiation.	Wilhelm Röntgen	Germany	canal-rays	Science: Physics	On November 5, 1895, he set his cathode-ray tube to working, and in the dimness, a flash of light that did not come from the tube caught his eye. A sheet of paper coated with barium platinocyanide (one of the chemicals he was planning to use) was glowing. The glow ceased when the cathode-ray tube was turned off. The coated paper glowed even in the next room once the cathode-ray tube was turned on. Radiation was clearly emerging from the tube when the cathode rays were streaming, and was penetrating matter to some extent Röntgen didn't know what the radiation might be, so he referred to it as X rays, X being the usual symbol for an unknown quantity in mathematics. He published his findings on December 18, 1895.		
cathode-ray-particles	1895	Cathode ray particles	It was demonstrated that cathode rays are streams of negatively charged particles and not waves, leading to a better understanding of their nature. This discovery was crucial in confirming the particle nature of cathode rays.	Jean-Baptiste Perrin	France	x-rays	Science: Physics	In 1895, however, a French physicist, Jean-Baptist Perrin (1870-1942), showed that when cathode rays were made to impinge upon a cylinder, the cylinder gradually gained a large negative charge. That finally settled the matter. Cathode rays were streams of negatively-charged particles, and no one has doubted it since.		
velocity-and-mass	1895	Velocity and mass	Research indicated that mass increases with velocity, posing that at the speed of light, mass becomes infinite, implying the speed of light as an absolute maximum. This theory contributed significantly to the understanding of the relationship between velocity and mass.	Hendrik Antoon Lorentz	Netherlands	fitzgerald-contraction, michelson-morley-experiment	Science: Physics	The negative results of the Michelson-Morley experiment (see 1887) still attracted the attention of physicists. The Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853-1928) came to the same conclusions that FitzGerald had come to concerning the shortening of distance with speed (see 1892) but went farther. It seemed to Lorentz that mass would have to increase with velocity and do so at a steadily increasing rate. At a speed of 160,000 miles per second, the mass of any object should have doubled, and at the speed of light (a little over 186,000 miles per second), it should become infinite. This idea made the speed of light appear to be an absolute maximum. As a result of Lorentz’s work,		
helium-on-earth	1895	Helium on earth	Helium was identified on Earth after being previously detected only in solar observations. Ramsey extracted it out of a uranium mineral. Like argon, this element didn't quite fit into the existing periodic table.	William Ramsay	Scotland	periodic-table-of-the-elements, argon	Science: Chemistry	Argon, discovered the year before by Rayleigh and Ramsay (see 1894), did not fit in with any existing family, but it seemed to be in the neighborhood of chlorine and potassium as far as its atomic weight was concerned. Since the periodic table was based largely on valence (see 1852), it made sense to put argon between chlorine and potassium. Chlorine and potassium each had a valence of 1, and since argon formed no combinations with other atoms at all, it had to have a valence of 0. The valence progression of 1, 0, 1 made sense, and argon would be the first member of a new family of elements of 0 valence. In that case, where were the others? Ramsay made it his business to look for them. In 1895 he learned that in America, samples of a gas taken for nitrogen had been obtained from a uranium mineral. That looked hopeful, for the 0-valence gases could be mistaken for the rather inert nitrogen but for no other gas. Ramsay repeated the work with a uranium mineral and got a gas that resembled nitrogen in its inertness. He tested the gas spectroscopically, however, and it did not produce the spectral lines of nitrogen. Instead it produced the spectral lines that Ramsay recognized as those detected by Janssen in sunlight (see 1868). Janssen’s solar element had been named helium, and now Ramsay had identified it on Earth, and found that it would lie between hydrogen and lithium in the periodic table. As to what helium might be doing in the uranium mineral, that was a puzzle, but the answer was not long in coming.		
curie-temperature	1895	Curie temperature	It was discovered that magnetism in ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, disappears at a specific temperature, known as the Curie temperature. This temperature varies for different metals, with iron losing its magnetism at 770°C.	Pierre Curie	France	electromagnetism	Science: Physics	People must have noticed that if a magnet was made red hot it would lose its magnetism. Curie (see 1880) showed that this was not a gradual effect. There was a specific temperature (now called the Curie temperature) at which the magnetism of iron disappeared. This happens to be 770° C. Other metals that have the same strong response to magnetism that iron does (and are therefore said to be ferromagnetic, from the Latin word for 'iron') also have Curie temperatures. For nickel it is 358° C, and for cobalt, 1131° C.		
radio-antennas	1895	Radio antennas	With a new detector, Branly could detect radio waves 150 yards from the source. Lodge improved it and demonstrated sending and receiving morse code, and then Popov and Marconi added antennas to strengthen the signal.	Edouard-Eugène Branly and others	France and others	radio-waves	Science: Physics	Once Hertz had demonstrated the existence of radio waves (see 1888), the possibility of using such waves in signaling across long distances occurred to a number of people. If one could use such radiation for the purpose, one could do away with total dependence on telegraph wires and cables. Indeed, the British call communications by radio waves wireless telegraphy or for short wireless. Americans call it radiotelegraphy or for short radio. Of course, to make such communication possible, one needs a far better detector than the simple loop Hertz used. In 1890 a French physicist, Edouard-Eugène Branly (1844-1940), invented a detector that consisted of a container of loosely packed metal filings. It ordinarily conducted little current, but it conducted quite a bit when radio waves fell upon		
uranium-radiations	1896	Uranium radiations	While studying the fluorescent substance potassium uranyl sulfate, Becquerel thought sunlight would make the crystal fluoresce and emit x-rays. He accidentally found that no sunlight was needed, and that the crystal was radiating x-rays on its own.	Antoine-Henri Becquerel	France	x-rays, dry-plates	Science: Physics	The discovery of X rays by Röntgen (see 1895) fascinated a French physicist, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908), who had been working on fluorescent substances as his father had before him. He wondered if perhaps the radiation given off by fluorescent substances might include X rays. A fluorescent substance both he and his father had		
dietary-deficiency-diseases	1896	Dietary deficiency diseases	Eijkman discovered that beriberi was a dietary deficiency disease caused by the absence of a substance found in the hulls of unpolished rice. This discovery was significant as it corrected the previous assumption that beriberi was a germ disease.	Christiaan Eijkman	Netherlands	scurvy, germ-theory-of-disease	Science: Medicine	People in the Dutch East Indies commonly suffered from beriberi, which produced weakness and death. Naturally it was assumed to be a germ disease, since Pasteur (see 1862) and others had been so successful at combating disease on that assumption. However, no one could find the germ that caused the disease. A Dutch physician, Christiaan Eijkman (1858-1930), who had gone to the East Indies to study the disease, was nonplussed. But then an ailment broke out in 1896 among the chickens being used at the laboratory for bacteriological researches. The chicken polyneuritis showed symptoms similar to beriberi, and Eijkman was busily studying the disease and checking on its contagiousness—when it suddenly disappeared and all the chickens got well. Eijkman investigated and found that during the period when the chickens had had the disease, they had been feeding on rice ordinarily meant for the human patients. The disease disappeared when a new cook put them back on commercial chicken feed. Eijkman found he could produce the chicken disease at will when he fed the chickens polished rice. By feeding them unpolished rice, he cured them. Eijkman was the first to correct a specific disease by diet since Lind had connected citrus fruits and scurvy (see 1747). Although Eijkman missed the point at first, it became clear that beriberi was a dietary deficiency disease. It was caused by the absence of some substance (present in the hulls of unpolished rice and not present in polished rice from which the hulls had been removed) that seemed necessary to health in small traces. For this discovery, Eijkman received a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1929.		
light-and-magnetism	1896	Light and magnetism	Maxwell thought that light was electromagnetic radiation, but whatever charge doing the oscillating had yet to be found. Lorentz and his student Zeeman suggested there might be electric charges within the atom, and found them by placing a strong magnetic field near an atom, confirming their spectral lines had changed. 	Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman	Netherlands	ionic-dissociation, radio-waves, maxwells-equations	Science: Physics			
ferments-and-enzymes	1896	Ferments and enzymes	Discovered that enzymes from yeast could function outside of the living cells, successfully fermenting sugar. From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen	Eduard Buchner	Germany	enzyme, mesmerism	Science: Chemistry, Biology	In 1896 a German chemist, Eduard Buchner (1860–1917), wondered if the enzymes in yeast would work if they were extracted from the living cell. To do this, he ground up yeast cells with sand until not one of them was left alive. He then filtered the material, obtaining a clear, cell-free liquid. He added sugar to preserve it against bacterial contamination and found that before long carbon dioxide was forming vigorously. The clear extract from the yeast was doing the job of fermenting sugar just as the intact cells would have, and Buchner had demonstrated the opposite of what he had expected. From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen. For this work, Buchner was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1907. From this point on, the term enzymes was applied to all biochemical catalysts, in or out of a cell, and another bastion of vitalism had fallen.		
acoustics	1896	Acoustics	Studied and solved the issue of sound clarity in a new lecture room with excessive reverberation. This led to the foundation of architectural acoustics and methods for designing auditoriums with clear sound.	Wallace Clement Ware Sabine	United States	mach-number, phonograph	Science: Physics	In 1896 an American physicist, Wallace Clement Ware Sabine (1868–1919), completed the study of a new lecture room that had been built at Harvard University the previous year. The lecture room had a flaw; the lecturer could not be heard because of excessive reverberation. Sabine had investigated every angle of the problem, even photographing sound waves that were made visible by the changes in light refraction they produced. As a result of his studies, Sabine founded the science of architectural acoustics. In the process he showed how to design a hall that would make the sounds of voice and music clear. For the purpose, he made use of mathematical equations that related absorptivity of sound by various materials and the volume of the room to the amount of reverberation.		
electron-as-subatomic-particle	1897	Electron as subatomic particle	Demonstrated that cathode rays are made of negatively charged particles which could be deflected by an electric field. This was the first discovery of a subatomic particle, smaller than an atom.	Joseph John Thomson	England	cathode-ray-particles, laws-of-electrolysis, fundamental-unit-of-electricity	Science: Physics	By now Perrin's work had convinced everyone that cathode rays consisted of negatively charged particles (see 1895). The last bit of evidence was supplied by the British physicist Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940), who showed that cathode rays could be deflected not only by a magnet but by an electric field. From the amount of the deflection, Thomson could work out the ratio of the electric charge of the cathode ray particle to its mass. This ratio turned out to be quite high, so that either the charge was high or the mass was low or both. Thomson supposed that the charge would be the unit charge worked out from Faraday's laws of electrolysis (see 1832). If so, the mass of the cathode ray particle would be only a small fraction of the hydrogen atom's, the smallest atom known. (We now know that the particle has a mass only 1/1837 of hydrogen's.) Thomson called the particle the electron, making use of Stoney's suggested name for the fundamental unit of electric charge (see 1891), since he suspected that the particle carried that fundamental unit. And to be sure, no smaller electric charge has actually been observed since then. The electron was the first subatomic particle (particle smaller than an atom) to be discovered.		
uranium-radiation-quantified	1897	Uranium radiation quantified	Used piezoelectricity to measure the intensity of radiation given off by uranium compounds. She found that the intensity was proportional to the amount of uranium, suggesting that radiation comes directly from the uranium atom, not the compound.	Marie Sklodowska Curie	France	piezoelectricity, uranium-radiations	Science: Physics			
alpha-rays-and-beta-rays	1897	Alpha rays and beta rays	Discovered two types of radiation emitted by uranium, which he named alpha rays and beta rays. Alpha rays are positively charged and more massive than beta rays, which are negatively charged.	Ernest Rutherford	England	uranium-radiations	Science: Physics	The radiations given off by uranium were of more than one kind. Some were deflected only slightly in a direction that indicated them to be positively charged. Some were deflected much more sharply in the opposite direction and were therefore negatively charged. Both had to consist of streams of particles, and the particles of the former were clearly the more massive.		
nickel-as-catalyst	1897	Nickel as catalyst	Found that powdered nickel could act as a catalyst to convert ethylene to ethane, which helped in creating edible fats from inedible plant oils. Nickel was much cheaper than platnium which had previous been used for this purpose.	Paul Sabatier	France	platinum-as-catalyst	Science: Chemistry	The metal nickel combines with carbon monoxide to form a compound that is liquid at ordinary temperatures and boils at 43°C. In 1897 the French chemist Paul Sabatier (1854–1941) wondered if other volatile nickel compounds could be formed by combining the metal with other gases. He chose ethylene for his attempt, since like carbon monoxide, it has a double bond. He failed, but found that some of the ethylene had, in the presence of nickel, changed to ethane. The double bond in ethylene had thus added two hydrogen atoms. That happens easily if a metal such as powdered platinum is used as a catalyst. Sabatier had now shown that powdered nickel, which was much cheaper, would do the same. Sabatier went on to perfect the technique, and nickel catalysis went on eventually to make possible the formation of edible fats, such as margarine and shortenings, from inedible plant oils, such as cotton-seed oil. For this work Sabatier was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1912.		
mosquitoes-and-malaria	1897	Mosquitoes and malaria	Ronald Ross discovered the malarial parasite in the anopheles mosquito, highlighting mosquitoes as disease vectors. This finding paved the way for malaria prevention by targeting mosquito breeding sites and using mosquito netting.	Ronald Ross	England	cattle-fever, malaria	Science: Medicine	Smith’s discovery of the manner in which ticks served to communicate disease (see 1893) turned the minds of pathologists in the direction of sighting insects as possible disease-spreaders. The British physician Ronald Ross (1857–1932) devoted himself to collecting, feeding, and dissecting mosquitoes until in 1897 he discovered the malarial parasite that had been identified by Laveran (see 1880) in the anopheles mosquito. This meant that malaria might well be fought by wiping out the breeding places of these mosquitoes, by making use of mosquito netting, and so on. For this, Ross received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1902.		
oscilloscope	1897	Oscilloscope	The oscilloscope was created by modifying the cathode-ray tube to display oscillations caused by varying electromagnetic fields. It laid the groundwork for modern television screens.	Karl Ferdinand Braun	Germany	cathode-rays	Science: Physics	In 1897 a German physicist, Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850–1918), modified the cathode-ray tube in such a way that the spot of green fluorescence formed by the stream of speeding particles shifted in accordance with the electromagnetic field set up by a varying current. The device was called an oscilloscope, because the spot could follow and reveal the oscillations of the field. Braun's device was the ancestor of the present-day television screen.		
large-refracting-telescope	1897	Large refracting telescope	A large refracting telescope with a 40-inch lens was constructed, reaching the limits of the arts. It was the largest of its kind and marked the limits of refracting telescopes.	Clark	England	telescope	Space	In 1897 Clark, the discoverer of Sirius's dim companion (see 1844), supervised the construction of a refracting telescope with a lens 40 inches across. It was the largest and best refractor built up to that time, but it had reached the limits of the art. No larger refractor has been built since then, or is likely to be built. All larger telescopes are of the reflecting variety that Newton invented (see 1668).		
diesel-engine	1897	Diesel engine	The diesel engine was perfected to ignite fuel through heat generated by compression, allowing for the use of safer, higher-boiling fuels. Its design enabled its use in heavy transport vehicles.	Rudolf Diesel	Germany	gas-laws, high-pressure, four-stroke-engine	Science: Engineering	The four-stroke engine invented by Otto (see 1876) used low-boiling gasoline for fuel and ignited the vapor-air mixture with an electric spark. A German inventor, Rudolf Diesel (1858–1913), tried to eliminate the complexities that resulted from running an electrical system in conjunction with an engine. By 1897 he had perfected a Diesel engine that ignited the vapor-air mixture by the heat developed through compression. This allowed him to use higher-boiling fuel such as kerosene, which was cheaper and less inflammable (hence safer) than gasoline. However, the compression had to be great, so the Diesel engine had to be considerably larger and heavier than the Otto engine if the higher pressures were to be brought about and maintained. Diesel engines therefore found their use in heavy transport vehicles such as trucks, buses, locomotives, and ships.		
polonium-and-radium	1898	Polonium and radium	Polonium and radium were discovered, demonstrating intense radioactivity. Thorium too was recognized as radioactive.This led to the coining of the term 'radioactivity' and awards for the Curies.	Marie and Pierre Curie	France	uranium-radiation-quantified, thorium	Science: Chemistry	Marie and Pierre Curie continued to work on the radiations produced by uranium and other heavy metals. In 1898 Marie Curie showed that thorium produced radiations and coined the term radioactivity. They discovered polonium and radium, which were intensely radioactive.		
neon-krypton-xenon	1898	Neon, krypton, and xenon	Krypton, neon, and xenon were discovered as new zero-valent noble gases. The discovery added to the understanding of the newly discovered noble (or inert) gas group which came to include argon and helium.	William Ramsay and Morris William Travers	England	argon, helium	Science: Chemistry	Polonium and radium were not the only elements discovered in 1898. William Ramsay discovered krypton, neon, and xenon with the help of Morris William Travers. These were part of the zero-valence and noble gases.		
liquid-hydrogen	1898	Liquid hydrogen	A new technique enabled the production of liquid hydrogen at very low temperatures. This was a significant advancement in gas liquefaction processes. However Helium remained a gas even at 20°K.	Carl von Linde	Germany	liquid-oxygen	Science: Chemistry	Carl von Linde developed a technique for cooling gases in stages, making it possible to produce commercial quantities of liquid air. James Dewar improved Linde's system and successfully liquefied hydrogen at only 20°K in 1898.		
phoebe	1898	Phoebe	A ninth satellite of Saturn, named Phoebe, was discovered. It orbits far from Saturn in a retrograde direction (clockwise rather than counterclockwise as seen above Saturn's north pole), suggesting it may be a captured asteroid.	William Henry Pickering	United States	saturn-satellites	Space	In 1898 the American astronomer William Henry Pickering (1858-1938) discovered a ninth satellite of Saturn, which he named Phoebe, after still another of the siblings of Saturn (Cronos) in the Greek myths. It was far more distant from Saturn than the satellites discovered earlier, and it revolved around the planet in a retrograde direction (clockwise rather than counterclockwise, if viewed from high above Saturn's north pole), so that it is considered to be a captured asteroid.		
eros	1898	Eros	Asteroid 433, named Eros, was discovered and it approaches Earth more closely than Mars or Venus. Its discovery led to the practice of naming asteroids with orbits extending outside the asteroid belt with masculine names.	Gustav Witt	Germany	asteroid-photography	Space	But then, on August 13, 1898, the German astronomer Gustav Witt discovered asteroid number 433. When its orbit was plotted, it proved to be a real stunner. At aphelion (when it is most distant from the Sun), it is well within the asteroid belt. At perihelion, however, it is only 105,000,000 miles from the Sun—well within the orbit of Mars. At its closest to the Earth, the two could be only a little over 14,000,000 miles apart. Since it approached Earth more closely than Mars or Venus did, Witt gave it the name of the child of Mars and Venus in the Greek myths—Eros. That began the habit of giving masculine names to asteroids whose orbits extend outside the asteroid belt.		
filtrable-virus	1898	Filtrable virus	Pasteur couldn't find the microorganism that caused rabies and suggested a smaller microorganism might be responsible. These viruses were identified: microorganisms smaller than bacteria capable of passing through filters that stop bacteria. This discovery laid the foundational principles for virology.	Martinus Willem Beijerinck	Netherlands	rabies	Science: Biology	In 1898 the Dutch botanist Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851-1931) did a similar experiment, but he had no hesitation in maintaining that there was a causative agent smaller than a bacterium, but capable of passing through a filter that could stop bacteria. He created the term 'virus' for such a filtrable causative agent. His term was quickly accepted, and he is generally considered the founder of virology as an independent branch of microbiology.		
mitochondria	1898	Mitochondria	Microscopes improved and it became clear that the cell had a complex structure. Mitochondria were identified as distinct structures within the cell's cytoplasm, initially named due to their thread-like appearance. This later revealed them to be crucial organelles with significant functions.	Carl Benda	Germany	cell-theory, chromatin	Science: Biology	As microscopes improved, it was clear that the cell did not consist of a homogeneous fluid but had a complex structure, even outside the nucleus. In 1898 the German histologist Carl Benda (1857–1933) made out tiny bodies in the cytoplasm. He called them mitochondria, from Greek words meaning “threads of cartilage,” which is what he thought they were. They turned out to be far more than that.		
epinephrine	1898	Epinephrine	Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, was studied and named after the discovery that deterioration of adrenal glands can cause Addison's disease. This became the first isolated hormone, despite the concept of hormones not being fully developed at the time.	John Jacob Abel	United States		Science: Biology	An American pharmacologist, John Jacob Abel (1857–1938), was able to study this substance in 1898, and he named it epinephrine (from Greek words meaning “above the kidney”). Three years later, a Japanese chemist, Jokichi Takamine (1854–1922), working in the United States, isolated the substance in pure, crystalline form. He called it adrenaline. Both names are still used. Actually epinephrine/adrenaline was the first hormone to be isolated, but the hormone concept had not yet been elaborated.		
submarine	1898	Submarine	Drebbel's attempt to make a submarine in 1620 required oars placed on the surface. The first sea-going submarine was built, marking the start of modern submarine technology. The Argonaut I successfully sailed fully submerged from Norfolk to New York.	Simon Lake	United States	ironclad-warships, high-pressure, four-stroke-engine	Design	Ships made to go under the water have been a human fancy for centuries, but the first to attempt to build one was a Dutch inventor, Cornelis Jacobszoon Drebbel (1572–1633), who piloted one in the Thames River between 1620 and 1624. An American inventor, David Bushnell (1742–1824), devised simple submarines that were used unsuccessfully against British ships in harbor during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. It was not till 1898, however, that an American mechanical engineer, Simon Lake (1866–1945), succeeded in devising a submarine that could actually go out to sea. In that year, his submarine Argonaut I sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to New York. This marked the true beginning of modern submarines.		
actinium	1899	Actinium	A new element, actinium, was isolated from uranium ores. It was named based on the Greek word for 'ray' and is equivalent to radium in Latin.	André-Louis Debierne	France	polonium-and-radium	Science: Chemistry	There was more in uranium ores than the polonium and radium that the Curies had detected (see 1898). In 1899 the French chemist André-Louis Debierne (1874–1949), a close friend of the Curies, isolated still another element from the ores. He called it actinium, from a Greek word for "ray," so that the name was the Greek equivalent of the Latin radium.		
logic-and-geometry	1899	Logic and geometry	Foundations of Geometry' proposed a set of axioms for geometry, focusing on the properties of points, lines, and planes. The system proved to be self-consistent, which was crucial for its acceptance.	David Hilbert	Germany	axiomatics	Math	In 1899 the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862–1943) published Foundations of Geometry, in which he proposed a set of axioms for geometry that was the most satisfactory yet. He began with points, lines, and planes as undefined concepts. It was not necessary to define them, merely to describe certain properties they possessed. He also used certain relationships, such as between, parallel, and continuous, without defining them. Again, provided the consequences of using those words were clearly set forth, it didn’t matter what they actually meant. Hilbert proved his system of axioms to be self-consistent, and that was crucial.		
solid-hydrogen	1899	Solid hydrogen	Solid hydrogen was produced, achieving the lowest temperature ever obtained at 14° K. At this temperature, helium still remained gaseous.	James Dewar	England	liquid-hydrogen	Science: Physics	Dewar, who had liquefied hydrogen the year before, took another step toward absolute zero by producing solid hydrogen in 1899. This brought the lowest temperature ever obtained down to 14° K. At this temperature, all known substances but one were solid. The only exception was helium, which even at this temperature remained gaseous.		
quanta	1900	Quanta	Planck developed an equation for black body radiation by hypothesizing that energy is emitted in discrete pieces called quanta. This discovery introduced the concept of energy quantization, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.	Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck	Germany	black-bodies, wavelengths-and-temperature	Science: Physics	Kirchnoff had pointed out that a black body (one that absorbed all electromagnetic radiation that fell on it) would radiate at all wavelengths if heated (see 1860). Thus, a hollow body with a small hole in it would absorb all the radiation that entered through the hole, for virtually none of it would be reflected and find its way out again. If such a body was heated, radiation would therefore emerge from the hole at all wavelengths, with very little at the extremes and with a peak at some intermediate value. The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength of the peak value. A number of physicists tried to work out mathematical equations for the distribution of wavelengths in such black body radiation. Rayleigh and Wien (see 1894) both advanced equations in 1900, but Rayleigh’s worked well only for the long-wavelength half, and Wien’s only for the short-wavelength half. Neither one could work out an equation that gave the distribution across the board. Then a German physicist, Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858-1947), produced an equation that did just that. In order to derive that equation, he had to assume that energy was given off not continuously but in discrete pieces, and that the size of the piece was inversely proportional to the wavelength. Thus, since violet light had half the wavelength of red light, violet light would be delivered in pieces that were twice the size, and therefore twice the energy content, of red light. Planck called the bits of energy quanta (singular, quantum, a Latin word meaning "how much?"). He worked out the relationship between energy and wavelength (or energy and frequency, since frequency is 1 divided by the wavelength), making use of a very small value called Planck’s constant, which represents the "graininess" of energy. Since Planck’s constant is exceedingly small, energy has a very fine grain indeed, and it is not noticeable except in special circumstances, so that the laws of thermodynamics could be deduced as though energy were a continuous fluid without grain. The problem of black body radiation was the first in which the graininess had to be taken into account. There was no evidence, at first, for the existence of quanta, except for the fact that it made the equation for black body radiation.		
mass-increase	1900	Mass increase	Lorentz's theory that mass increases with velocity was confirmed through observations of electrons moving at 90% of the speed of light. 	Hendrik Antoon Lorentz	Netherlands	velocity-and-mass, cathode-ray-particles	Science: Physics	Lorentz had maintained that mass increased with velocity (see 1895). It did not seem at the time that this could ever be checked, for the velocities needed to make the change in mass measurable were too huge to deal with in the laboratory. As physicists began to study the speeding electrons involved in cathode rays, and in other phenomena, however, it turned out that electrons might be moving at respectable fractions of the speed of light—up to 90 percent in some cases. This meant the mass increase ought to be measurable, since fast electrons, becoming more massive than slow ones, would bend less sharply in response to electromagnetic fields. This turned out to be so, and the increase in mass, measured in 1900 for the first time, matched quite closely the theoretical predictions of Lorentz. The Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction was borne out, but physicists had to wait five more years before a comprehensive physical theory that explained it was advanced.		
beta-particles	1900	Beta particles electrons	Becquerel determined that beta particles were actually electrons through his studies of uranium radiation. This finding linked electrons not just to electric currents but also to atomic structure, particularly in radioactive atoms.	Antoine-Henri Becquerel	France	alpha-rays-and-beta-rays, uranium-radiation-quantified	Science: Physics	Becquerel, who had discovered uranium radiations (see 1896) continued to study them. The beta rays were clearly composed of negatively charged beta particles, and from the way these curved in a magnetic field of a particular strength, they seemed to resemble electrons. In 1900, after a close study of the properties of beta particles, Becquerel decided that they were electrons. Until then, electrons had seemed to be associated only with electric currents, as in the case of cathode rays. Now it seemed they were associated with atoms as well—at least with radioactive atoms.		
gamma-rays	1900	Gamma rays	Paul Ulrich Villard discovered gamma rays while studying uranium radiation. These rays were even more pentrating than x-rays and characterized by their short wavelength, distinguishing them from alpha and beta rays.	Paul Ulrich Villard	France	alpha-rays-and-beta-rays, x-rays	Science: Physics	In 1900 the French physicist Paul Ulrich Villard (1860–1934), studying the radiations from uranium that Becquerel had discovered, noted that in addition to alpha rays and beta rays, there was some radiation that was totally unaffected by magnets. This, it was decided, consisted of electromagnetic radiation. Its properties were very much like those of X rays, but it was even more penetrating and therefore even shorter in wavelength. It came to be called gamma rays, after the third letter of the Greek alphabet.		
radon	1900	Radon	Friedrich Ernst Dorn discovered that radium emits a radioactive gas, later identified as the noble gas radon. This addition expanded the understanding of radioactive elements and noble gases.	Friedrich Ernst Dorn	Germany	polonium-and-radium	Science: Chemistry	A German physicist, Friedrich Ernst Dorn (1848–1916), studying the radium that Curie had discovered (see 1898), found in 1900 that it gave off not only radiations but a gas that was itself radioactive. The gas was called radium emanation at first, but on closer study it turned out to be a noble gas (see 1898), the sixth one, and was named radon.		
atomic-change	1900	Atomic change	Crookes discovered a method for treating uranium compounds in a way to make them much less radioactive. Uranium might not be radioactive after all. Becquerel suggested that this was due to a spontaneous change of one atom into another, the first suggestion of its kind.	William Crookes	England	uranium-radiation-quantified	Science: Chemistry	In 1900 Crookes (see 1861) found that it was possible to treat a solution of uranium compound in such a way that part of it would be removed as an insoluble material. The removed portion was an impurity, the uranium compound itself remaining in solution.		
electron-emission	1900	Electron emission	Heated metals were found to emit speeding electrons which carried electricity. This a phenomenon advanced electronic technology development.	Owen Willans Richardson	England	edison-effect	Science: Physics	Beginning in 1900, the British physicist Owen Willans Richardson (1879–1959) studied the phenomenon and realized that heated metals tended to emit speeding electrons, which carried the electricity. His observation made it possible to apply the Edison effect to the developing electronic technology. For his work, he received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1928.		
mutations	1900	Mutations	Research on the American evening primrose flower led to the discovery of visible changes in organisms, termed mutations. This concept advanced evolutionary theory by emphasizing broader changes in traits across generations.	Hugo Marie De Vries	Netherlands	genetics	Science: Biology	The American evening primrose had been introduced into the Netherlands in the 1880s, and in 1886 a Dutch botanist, Hugo Marie De Vries (1848–1935), came across a colony of them growing in a clump in a meadow. He could see that some were very different from others, even though it seemed likely that all had grown from a common batch of seeds. He dug them up, took them to his garden, and bred them separately and together. By 1900 he had evolved the laws of genetics that Mendel had worked out (see 1865). Unknown to De Vries and to each other, two other botanists were making the same rediscovery. One was a German, Karl Erich Correns (1864–1933), and the other an Austrian, Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg (1871–1962). Each of the three independently decided to publish his discovery, and each of the three found, on searching the literature, that he had been anticipated by Mendel. Each of the three (in a remarkable display of scientific ethics) reported Mendel as the discoverer and presented his own work merely as confirmation. De Vries, however, went beyond Mendel. He had observed that the primroses didn’t always breed true, that some characteristics appeared that didn’t seem to exist in earlier generations. He suggested, therefore, that evolution did not always proceed in small, nearly microscopic steps, but sometimes in changes large enough to be clearly visible. He called these visible changes mutations (from a Latin word for “change”), and indeed the concept of mutations now forms an integral and indispensable part of the theory of evolution.		
blood-types	1900	Blood types	Specific properties of human blood were demonstrated, classifying it into four types: O, A, B, and AB. Plasma of some types of blood introduced into some patients could clump red cells and block blood vessels, leading to death. This breakthrough significantly improved the safety and effectiveness of blood transfusions.	Karl Landsteiner	Austria	blood-color, microscope	Science: Medicine	An Austrian physician, Karl Landsteiner (1868-1943), was able to demonstrate some specific properties of human blood. Plasma (the liquid portion of blood) from one donor might clump red cells from person A but not from person B. Serum from another donor might clump red cells from person B but not from person A. Still other samples of plasma might clump both - or neither. Clumped red cells could block blood vessels and lead to death. Therefore, it was necessary in performing a blood transfusion to know that the blood of the donor would not clump the red cells of the receiver. Landsteiner showed that human blood fell into four classes: O, A, B, and AB. It was always safest if both donor and receiver were in the same class. In an emergency, O blood could be given to any receiver, but A blood could be given only to A and AB receivers, B blood only to B and AB receivers, and AB blood only to AB receivers. Landsteiner made blood transfusion rational and safe and added an important weapon to the medical armory. For this discovery, he received the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1930.		
yellow-fever	1900	Yellow fever	Yellow fever was a severe problem in coastal cities, with many deaths following outbreaks. Research in 1900 showed that it is transmitted by mosquitoes, leading to control efforts by targeting mosquito populations.	Walter Reed	United States	malaria	Science: Medicine	Yellow fever was a terrifying scourge of coastal cities. New York and Philadelphia, for instance, were periodically hit, and many deaths followed. The Spanish-American War made the United States particularly disease-conscious, as far more American soldiers died from disease and from tainted meat than died from enemy bullets. The American military surgeon Walter Reed (1851-1902) was sent to Cuba in 1899 to see if he could do something about yellow fever. He had already showed, in 1897, that it was not caused by a bacterium, as had been earlier proposed. His studies in Cuba showed that the disease was not transmitted by bodily contact, by clothing, or by bedding. He suspected mosquito carriers, as Ross had shown was the case with malaria (see 1897). The case was proved for yellow fever, too, in 1900, when doctors allowed mosquitoes to sting patients and then themselves. One doctor, Jesse William Lazear (1866-1900), died as a result. Yellow fever was brought under control by fighting mosquitoes and destroying their breeding grounds. The last yellow fever epidemic in the United States was in New Orleans in 1905.		
dreams	1900	Dreams	Dreams were historically interpreted as supernatural or spiritual events. Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams" gave them a scientific meaning, suggesting they reveal truths about our unconscious mind.	Sigmund Freud	Austria	unconscious-mind	Science: Psychology	Dreams had always mystified human beings. Dreaming that dead people were alive helped lead to a belief in the spirit world. Erotic dreams led to belief in incubi and succubi. Dreams seemed to be doorways into a different world, to be messages from the gods, to be revelations of events at a distance or in the future. All this was dismissed as superstition by rationalists, but Freud (see 1884) gave new meaning to dreams. In 1900 he published The Interpretation of Dreams. Dreams, he maintained, might represent truths about human beings that they were not willing to accept in their waking hours, so that psychoanalysis might be hastened and aided by: the study of dreams.		
tryptophan	1900	Tryptophan	By this point, thirteen different amino acids had been isolated. Tryptophan is an amino acid isolated from protein molecules broken down by the digestive enzyme trypsin. It plays a significant role in dietetics and food chemistry.	Frederick Gowland Hopkins	England	nucleic-acid, organic-synthesis	Science: Biology	By now, some thirteen different amino acids had been isolated, each of which were among the building blocks of protein molecules. Still another was isolated in 1900 by the British biochemist Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861-1947). He called it tryptophan, from Greek words meaning "appearing through trypsin," because he had obtained it from protein molecules that had been broken down by the digestive enzyme trypsin.		
free-radicals	1900	Free radicals	Gomberg experimented with compounds with unusual structure. First he studied the compound consisting of a carbon atom to four different benzene rings, then he failed to create one with two carbons hooked to six benzene rings which would always break apart. Such groupings became known as radicals.	Moses Gomberg	United States	organic-synthesis, benzene-ring	Science: Chemistry	Organic chemists find it interesting to try to synthesize compounds of unusual structure. The Russian-born American chemist Moses Gomberg (1866-1947) tried to attach a carbon atom to four different benzene rings. There is scarcely room around a single carbon atom for four such bulky groupings, and a number of chemists had tried and failed. Gomberg, however, succeeded in forming small quantities of his compound, called tetraphenylmethane.		
dirigible	1900	Dirigible	A balloon with a steam engine would be impractically heavy, but internal-combustion engine and propellers took flight, allowing controlled movement independent of wind. This invention marked the creation of the dirigible or zeppelin.	Ferdinand Adolf August Heinrich von Zeppelin	Germany	hot-air-balloon, four-stroke-engine, aerodynamics	Science: Aviation	On July 2, 1900, one of Zeppelin's cigar-shaped vessels rose into the air. Beneath it was a gondola bearing an internal-combustion engine and a propeller. For the first time, an aircraft was not at the mercy of the wind but could move in any direction at will. It was called a dirigible balloon; that is, "a balloon that could be directed." This was soon abbreviated to dirigible, and the device was also sometimes called a zeppelin after its inventor.		
knossos-excavation	1900	Knossos excavation	Archaeological excavations revealed that a complex civilization existed in Crete nearly two thousand years before the Trojan War. This discovery provided evidence of an advanced society that dominated parts of the Greek mainland and Aegean islands.	Arthur John Evans	England	troy	Geography: Archaeology	During classical times, Crete had lain outside the current of history and was little regarded. Yet Homer, describing the Trojan War, gave Crete an important role, and in the Greek myths, Crete, under its king Minos, was described as dominating Greece in early times. A British archaeologist, Arthur John Evans (1851–1941), felt there might be some historical fact in that myth and, beginning in 1894, he engaged in archaeological excavations in Greece. By 1900 he had dug up the site of Knossos, the capital of Crete in Minos's legendary time. (Evans called it the Minoan civilization after the king.) He showed that a complex and advanced civilization had indeed existed for nearly two thousand years before the Trojan War, and that it had indeed dominated the islands of the Aegean and parts of the Greek mainland for a long period.		
radioactive-energy	1901	Radioactive energy	Measured the heat emission of radium as it emitted radiation, discovering it released consistent energy over many centuries. This finding indicated a previously unknown energy source within the atom, leading to the concept of atomic energy.	Pierre Curie	France	polonium-and-radium	Science: Physics	In 1901 Pierre Curie measured the heat given off by radium as it emitted radiation. He determined that each gram of radium gave off 140 calories per hour. This becomes much more surprising when one realizes that radium continues to emit energy at this rate hour after hour after hour for years and centuries. It falls off with time, but only slowly, and even after 1600 years, the rate of energy emission is still half of what it was at the start. The total energy emitted by radium (or by radioactive substances generally) was far beyond anything humanity had experience with in ordinary chemical changes, such as the burning of fuel or the shattering of explosives. Curie’s finding was the first indication that a new, hitherto unknown, but enormous energy source existed somewhere inside the atom. But until the details of the internal structure of the atom were discovered, and the nature of the changes that gave rise to radioactivity were worked out, scientists could only refer to this new energy source as atomic energy.		
radio	1901	Radio	Radio signals were successfully sent from England to Newfoundland. The event marked the invention of the radio.	Guglielmo Marconi	Italy	radio-antennas	Science: Physics	The sending of signals by radio waves reached a climax on December 12, 1901. Marconi broadcast radio waves from the southeastern tip of England, using balloons to lift his antenna as high as possible. The signals were received in Newfoundland. This day is usually considered the one on which the radio was invented, and Marconi is given credit as the inventor.		
europium	1901	Europium	Europium, a rare earth element, was discovered. It was named in honor of Europe.	Eugène-Anatole Demarcay	France	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry	The French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarcay (1852–1903) detected a twelfth, which he named europium in honor of Europe.		
grignard-reagents	1901	Grignard reagents	Grignard reagents, useful for attaching carbon-containing groups to organic molecules, were discovered. They are crucial for building complicated compounds in organic chemistry.	Victor Grignard	France	valence-theory	Science: Chemistry	The French chemist Victor Grignard (1871–1935) was searching for methods of attaching carbon-containing groups to organic molecules. He needed a catalyst. Zinc shavings and magnesium shavings did some good but not much. Frankland had reported on zinc combinations with organic compounds using diethyl ether as the solvent. Grignard tried it with magnesium instead, in 1901, and found he had the catalyst he needed. Magnesium-organic compounds dissolved in diethyl ether are called Grignard reagents and proved extraordinarily useful to organic chemists who were trying to build up relatively complicated compounds. For this work, Grignard shared with Sabatier the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1912.		
chromosomes-and-inheritance	1902	Chromosomes and inheritance	The role of chromosomes in inheritance was confirmed, linking them to Mendel's genetic factors. This discovery established chromosomes as carriers of genetic information, verifying Mendel's earlier theories.	Walter Stanborough Sutton	England	chromosome, mutations, meiosis	Science: Genetics	Mendel, in working out the laws of genetics (see 1865), had suggested that for every characteristic there was a pair of factors. Mother and father each contributed one of that pair to the offspring, who in this way inherited characteristics from each parent. By the time Mendel's work had been rediscovered by De Vries and others (see 1900), the role of chromosomes in cell division of sex cells had been researched by Beneden (see 1883). In 1902, then, an American geneticist, Walter Stanborough Sutton (1877–1916), made a suggestion that in hindsight seems obvious. He pointed out that chromosomes were (or contained) the genetic factors Mendel spoke of. He proved to be correct.		
secretin	1902	Secretin	Cutting all the nerves leading to the pancreas did not prevent it from working. This led to the discovery that the small intestine lining secreted "secretin", under the influence of scomath acid. Starling and Bayliss had discovered that it was possible for chemical messages as well as nerve messages to exist in the body. This finding laid the foundation for the study of hormones in the body.	Ernest Henry Starling and William Maddock Bayliss	England	epinephrine, islets-of-langerhans	Science: Physiology	The pancreas begins to secrete its digestive juice as soon as the acid food contents of the stomach enter the small intestine. How does the pancreas 'know' that food, requiring digestion, is making its appearance? The natural assumption is that entering food stimulates a nerve that in turn stimulates the pancreas. The Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936) suggested that this was so. Two British physiologists, Ernest Henry Starling (1866–1927) and his brother-in-law, William Maddock Bayliss (1860–1924), tested the matter. They cut all the nerves leading to the pancreas—yet it still performed on cue. They then discovered that the lining of the small intestine secreted a substance (which they named secretin) under the influence of stomach acid. It was this secretin that stimulated the pancreatic flow. In short, then, Starling and Bayliss had discovered that it was possible for chemical messages as well as nerve messages to exist in the body. Eventually other chemical messengers were discovered and Starling suggested they be called hormones, from Greek words meaning 'to rouse to activity.' Secretin was the first hormone to be recognized as such, but epinephrine, isolated by Abel (see 1898), turned out to be a hormone also.		
animal-inheritance	1902	Animal inheritance	The application of Mendel's genetic laws to animals demonstrated that the same principles governing plant genetics also apply to animal genetics. This discovery extended Mendel's theories beyond botany to zoology.	William Bateson	England	genetics	Science: Genetics	Mendel's work, once rediscovered, created an enormous stir. The British biologist William Bateson (1861–1926) was a strong supporter of Mendelian views and translated his papers into English. Mendel, together with the rediscoverers of the laws of genetics, had worked with plants, in which breeding was easier to control and inheritance easier to study than in animals. Bateson showed that the same laws of genetics that applied to plants applied also to animals.		
anaphylactic-shock	1902	Anaphylactic shock	Anaphylaxis was discovered when animals injected with an immune serum to a specific foreign protein died upon re-exposure to the antigen. These reactions were named after the Greek for "overprotection", and weaker versions became known as allergies.	Charles Robert Richet	France	antitoxin	Science: Immunology	The French physiologist Charles Robert Richet (1850–1935) worked on immune sera, the sort of thing that Behring had used successfully. Seemingly paradoxically, under certain conditions, doses of what is normally beneficial can, on second exposure, resensitize creatures to such an extent that a tiny, harmless dose can be fatal. Richet termed this phenomenon 'anaphylaxis' (Greek for 'against the shield'), and further work eventually helped to develop the science of immunology.		
sutures	1902	Sutures	A technique for delicately stitching together blood vessels end-to-end was developed, requiring as few as three stitches. This advancement significantly improved surgical.	Alexis Carrel	France	capillaries	Science: Medicine	The French surgeon Alexis Carrel was particularly deft in the field of blood-vessel repair. He developed a technique by which blood vessels could be delicately sutured (sewn together) end to end, requiring as few as three stitches for the job. This technique's usefulness in surgery led to Carrel’s being awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1912.		
radioactive-series	1902	Radioactive series	It was discovered that uranium and thorium break down into a sequence of intermediate elements. This meant that one could speak of a radioactive series.	Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy	England	atomic-change	Science: Chemistry	Crookes discovered that much of uranium’s radioactivity could be precipitated and that the radioactivity would spontaneously return thereafter. Rutherford and his assistant Frederick Soddy showed that by subjecting uranium and thorium to chemical manipulations, the elements break down into a series of intermediate elements, forming a radioactive series.		
photoelectric-effect-and-electrons	1902	Photoelectric effect and electrons	Lenard showed that light falling on certain metals causes electron emission and established the relationship between the light's wavelength and the emitted electrons' energy.  The photoelectric effect made it appear that electrons existed in matter even when electric currents were not involved.	Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard	Germany	photoelectric-effect	Science: Physics	Hertz had first noted the photoelectric effect - the greater ease with which electric sparks cross small gaps when ultraviolet light falls on those gaps. Lenard showed in 1902 that the electrical effects produced by light falling upon certain metals were due to electrons being emitted from the metal surface. He showed that only light of a certain wavelength or shorter could emit electrons from the metal, and the emitted electron's energy was directly related to the light's wavelength.		
kennelly-heaviside-layer	1902	Kennelly-heaviside layer	The Kennelly-Heaviside layer is a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere that reflects radio waves, allowing long-distance radio communication. It was proposed in 1902 to explain how Marconi's messages were heard over such vast distances but not confirmed for twenty years.	Arthur Edwin Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside	United States and England	radio	Science: Physics	The fact that Marconi's message, generated in southwestern England, was picked up in Newfoundland presented a puzzle. Electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, travels in straight lines. A British-born American electrical engineer, Arthur Edwin Kennelly (1861-1939), suggested that there might be a layer of electric charges in the upper atmosphere, which would serve to reflect radio waves.		
stratosphere	1902	Stratosphere	The stratosphere is a layer of the atmosphere starting above the 7-mile mark where the temperature remains constantly cold and weather phenomena do not occur. This discovery was crucial for understanding atmospheric layers and their influence on weather.	Léon-Philippe Teisserenc de Bort	France	scientific-ballooning	Science: Meteorology	Teisserenc de Bort suggested that the atmosphere be divided into two parts. The lower part, below the 7-mile mark, had temperature variations and therefore produced winds, clouds, and in short, the weather changes so familiar to us. This would be called the tropopause. Above it would be the constant-temperature stratosphere ("sphere of layers," because Teisserenc de Bort felt that constant temperature meant the gases would lie in undisturbed layers).		
symbolic-logic-and-mathematics	1902	Symbolic logic and mathematics	Frege attempted to provide an even more rigorous foundation for mathematics by minimizing assumptions and proving steps logically. Before its publication, however, Bertrand Russel found an apparent self-contradiction in Frege's system known as Russel's paradox. This failure would have important ramifications in mathematics.	Gottlob Frege	Germany	symbolic-logic	Math	The German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) improved and extended Boole's system of symbolic logic (see 1847). In fact, he spent almost twenty years putting together a system of symbolic logic that would serve as the basis of all mathematics, reducing it to complete rigor by minimizing assumptions and proving each step.		
ultramicroscope	1902	Ultramicroscope	The ultramicroscope worked by sending a beam of light through a colloidal solution and viewing the light scattered at right angles to the beam through a microscope. This allowed people to view colloidal particles which were invisible to ordinary microscopes.	Richard Adolf Zsigmondy	Germany	microscope	Science: Chemistry	The Austrian-born German chemist Richard Adolf Zsigmondy (1865–1929) took advantage of the scattering of light by colloidal particles in 1902. He sent a beam of light through a colloidal solution and viewed the light scattered at right angles to the beam through a microscope. In this way, colloidal particles, invisible to ordinary microscopes, could be seen, in what Zsigmondy called an ultramicroscope. For his work on colloids with his ultramicroscope, Zsigmondy was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1925.		
airplane	1903	Airplane	Internal-combustion engines were adapted to gliders, resulting in the successful creation of the first powered airplane which flew for almost a minute and covered 850 feet. This breakthrough marked the dawn of powered flight and contributed significantly to the field of aviation.	Orville and Wilbur Wright	United States	glider-improved, dirigible, bicycle, rubber-tire	Science: Engineering	Once Lilienthal had devised his gliders (see 1853), it seemed natural to think of putting an internal-combustion engine on a glider as Zeppelin had done for balloons (see 1900). The American astronomer Samuel Pierpont Langley (1834-1906) made the attempt on three separate occasions between 1897 and 1903 and almost succeeded but not quite. Then two brothers, Orville (1871-1948) and Wilbur (1867-1912) Wright took up the task. They made shrewd corrections in design and invented "ailerons," movable wing tips that enabled the pilot to control the plane. In addition, they built a crude wind tunnel to test their models, and they designed new engines of unprecedented lightness for the power they could deliver. On December 13, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville Wright made the first powered flight in a heavier-than-air machine. It remained in the air for almost a minute and covered 850 feet. Such devices soon came to be called airplanes.		
space-flight	1903	Space flight	Space flight began to receive scientific attention with theoretical work on rocketry, space suits, satellites, and space colonization. This foundational work laid the groundwork for future space exploration.	Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky	Russia	stratosphere	Space	Oddly enough, in the same year that air flight became a reality, space flight began to receive true scientific attention. In 1903 a Russian physicist, Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935), began a series of articles for an aviation magazine in which he went into the theory of rocketry quite thoroughly. He wrote of space suits, satellites, and the colonization of the solar system. He was the first to suggest the possibility of a space station.		
electrocardiogram	1903	Electrocardiogram	The electrocardiogram (EKG) was developed using a string galvanometer to record the heart's electrical potentials. It became a crucial tool in diagnosing heart conditions based on rhythmic electric potentials.	Willem Einthoven	Netherlands	electrical-stimulation	Science: Medicine	That muscles gave rise to tiny electric potentials had been known since Galvani's time (see 1780). It seemed natural to suppose, then, that the heart, beating rhythmically, might give rise to rhythmic electric potentials. Perhaps a departure from the natural rhythm might be used to diagnose pathological conditions before they could be discovered in any other way. The problem was to detect the small currents with sufficient accuracy. In 1903 a Dutch physiologist, Willem Einthoven (1860-1927), developed the first string galvanometer. This consisted of a delicate conducting thread stretched across a magnetic field. A current flowing through the thread would cause it to deviate at right angles to the direction of the magnetic lines of force. The delicacy of the device was sufficient to make it possible to record the varying electrical potentials of the heart. The result was an electrocardiogram. The abbreviation is EKG because in German -cardio- is spelled with a K. For the development of electrocardiography, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1924.		
electronic-rectifier	1904	Electronic rectifier	A British engineer discovered that a hot filament and cold plate in a glass vessel can rectify current, creating a device that lets electricity flow in only one direction. Fleming called it a valve, but they came to be known as radio tubes. Today, because they contain two electrodes, they are called diodes.	John Ambrose Fleming	England	edison-effect	Science: Physics	A British electrical engineer, John Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945), studied the Edison effect on a hot filament and a cold plate enclosed in an evacuated glass vessel and separated by a gap. He noted that the electric current only flowed across the gap if the hot filament was the negative electrode (the cathode) and the cold plate was the positive electrode (the anode). In that case, electrons poured into the hot filament and were driven off by the heat. If the current was reversed and electrons poured into the cold plate, there was insufficient energy to send them flying outward.If an alternating current was sent through the vessel, the anode and cathode changed place many times a second, and there was a spurt of electrons each time the filament was a cathode but nothing when it was an anode. The current went in as an alternating current but came flowing out in only one direction, as a direct current, even if the flow was in little gushes.  In this way, the vessel containing the filament and plate acted as an electronic rectifier, because it let electricity through in only one direction. Fleming called it a valve, which is descriptive. In the United States, however, it was for some reason called a tube, which is not descriptive. Because it contains two electrodes, it can also be called a diode.  Fleming’s rectifier was the first of a long line of radio tubes (so called because they became most familiar to the general public in radios) that made electronic devices work. 		
atomic-structure	1904	Atomic structure	The discovery and understanding of the electron's emission from various metals were facilitated by the photoelectric effect. Thus atoms themselves must have a structure involving electrons. Thomson suggested the atom was positively charged, with negatively charged electrons embedded like raising in a pound cake. This led to further thinking about the atomic structure.	Joseph John Thomson	England	photoelectric-effect, electron-as-subatomic-particle	Science: Physics	With the discovery of the electron and its emission from many different metals by way of the photoelectric effect, there was no use in		
coenzyme	1904	Coenzyme	While studying yeast, Harden discovered that some enzymes require a small molecule called a coenzyme to function as a catalyst. This can be any nonprotein structure that proves essential to the activities of an enzyme. Not all enzymes require coenzymes, but this dichotomy explained a lot of mysteries.	Arthur Harden	England	ferments-and-enzymes, osmosis	Science: Biology	In 1904, the British biochemist Arthur Harden placed an extract of yeast in a bag made of a semipermeable membrane to dialyze the extract and remove small molecules. Harden discovered that the material left behind in the bag lost its enzymatic activity unless the material from outside the bag was added back, showing the necessity of a small molecule coenzyme.		
organic-tracers	1904	Organic tracers	The body is a "black box" in the sense that we know that food and air goes in, and waste products come out, but it is very difficult to understand the metabolism that happens in-between. Benzene rings were used as tracers to study intermediate metabolism in the body.	Franz Knoop	Germany	benzene-ring, digestion	Science: Biology	In 1904, Franz Knoop, a German biochemist, added benzene rings to the long carbon chains of the fatty acids, expecting that the benzene rings would show up in the urine. This was aimed to give insight into the body's intermediate metabolism processes.		
novocaine	1904	Novocaine	Novocaine was discovered as a safer alternative to cocaine for use as a local anesthetic. It became highly important to dentists for pain management. However, a similar experiment modifying a molecule of morphine revealed an even more effective pain-reliever. It was heroin.	Alfred Einhorn	Germany	cocaine, morphine	Science: Medicine	Alkaloids such as cocaine and morphine are extremely useful as painkillers, but they have serious physiological effects and are addictive. Plants, after all, do not make them for the sake of animals, but for self-protection. Organic chemists strove to modify the alkaloid molecule in an effort to find a substitute that kept some of the good aspects while losing some of the bad ones. In 1904, for instance, a molecule named novocaine, or procaine, was found, with a structure something like part of a cocaine molecule. It acted as a local anesthetic but was much safer to use than cocaine, so that it became highly important to dentists.		
star-streams	1904	Star streams	Astronomers discovered that stars in the Milky Way Galaxy move in two huge streams in opposite directions: one containing 2/5ths of the stars, the other with the remainder. This finding suggested an order in the movement of stars that was previously thought to be random.	Jacobus Cornelis Kapteyn	Netherlands	stellar-motion, galaxy-observed	Space	When Halley first noted that stars moved (see 1718), astronomers strove to determine the motions of as many stars as possible, and the usual conclusion was that they moved randomly. The Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelis Kapteyn (1851-1922) found out differently. Observing numerous stars, he was able to conclude by 1904 that there were two huge streams of stars moving in opposite directions; three-fifths of the stars were in one, and two-fifths in the other. The reason for this wasn’t clear, but at least it showed that there was order to the movement of the many millions of stars that made up the Milky Way Galaxy. The nature of that order became clear a quarter-century later.		
jupiters-outer-satellites	1904	Jupiter’s outer satellites	A small satellite circling Jupiter was discovered, less than 110 miles across, marking the sixth known satellite of Jupiter. Next year, a seventh even smaller one, only 50 miles across was found.	Charles Dillon Perrine	United States	jupiter-moons	Space	The large satellites had by now all been discovered, but there still remained small ones to find. In 1904 the American astronomer Charles Dillon Perrine (1867-1951) discovered a small satellite circling Jupiter. It was the sixth to be discovered and was no more than 110 miles across. The next year he discovered another, also of tiny diameter.		
special-relativity	1905	Special relativity	Special relativity proposes that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and leads to conclusions like length contraction and time dilation. It marks a significant shift in understanding fundamental physics, emphasizing the relative nature of space and time.	Albert Einstein	Switzerland	velocity-and-mass, laws-motion	Science: Physics	The Michelson-Morley experiment (see 1887) was still troublesome. The work of FitzGerald (see 1892) and Lorentz (see 1895) got rid of the difficulty in a way, but the notion of decrease of distance and increase of mass seemed to hang in the air without an overall physical theory for support. The German-born physicist Albert Einstein (1879-1955) supplied that in 1905. He began with the assumption that the speed of light in a vacuum would always be the same, regardless of the motion of the light source relative to the observer. This was what Michelson and Morley had observed, but Einstein maintained that he was unaware of the Michelson-Morley results when he worked out his theory. From this assumption it was possible to deduce length contraction and mass increase with velocity. It was also possible to deduce that the speed of light in a vacuum was an absolute speed limit and that the rate of time-flow would decrease with velocity. This is Einstein's theory of special relativity. It is relativity, because velocity has meaning only as relative to an observer, there being no such thing as 'absolute rest' against which an 'absolute motion' can be measured. There is also no such		
mass-energy	1905	Mass-energy	The mass-energy equivalence principle shows that mass is a concentrated form of energy, represented by the equation e=mc^2. This extended the law of conservation of energy to include mass as another form of energy, and is sometimes known as the law of conservation of mass-energy.	Albert Einstein	Switzerland	special-relativity	Science: Physics	Another consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity is that mass must be viewed as a highly concentrated form of energy. Einstein's equation representing this is the famous e = mc^2. The speed of light is so huge that to square it and multiply it by even a small amount of mass is to represent a large amount of energy. Whenever any process gives off energy, it loses a little mass; when it absorbs energy, it gains a little mass. This led to the inclusion of mass as one more form of energy, making the law of conservation of energy more precise and extending it into what is sometimes known as the law of conservation of mass-energy.		
photoelectric-effect-and-quanta	1905	Photoelectric effect and quanta	Combining the photoelectric effect with quantum theory demonstrated that light quanta can eject electrons from metal surfaces only if they have sufficient energy based on their frequency. This discovery helped establish the particle nature of light.	Albert Einstein	Switzerland	quanta, photoelectric-effect	Science: Physics	In 1905 the photoelectric effect, as observed by Lenard, was combined with quantum theory by Einstein. He showed that if light consisted of quanta, with energies proportional to frequency, then the atoms in a metal surface could only absorb intact quanta. Long-wavelength quanta would not supply enough energy to eject an electron from the metal, no matter how intense the light might be. Short-wavelength quanta, however, provided sufficient energy.		
brownian-motion-atomic-size	1905	Brownian motion and atomic-size	Einstein's work on Brownian motion explained the random movement of particles in a fluid, providing valuable insight into molecular and atomic sizes. He formulated an equation for Brownian motion, which found numerous applications.	Albert Einstein	Germany	brownian-motion	Science: Physics	Einstein analyzed the bombardment of particles such as those in a fluid, explaining the random movement known as Brownian motion. He developed an equation to account for the size of molecules and the atoms making them up.		
color-and-stellar-luminosity	1905	Color and stellar luminosity	Hertzsprung devised an absolute measure of star brightness, measuring its luminosity from a standard distance of 10 parsecs (about 32 light years) away. An interesting finding was that there were no red stars of intermediate luminosity. This helped compare the real luminosities of different stars.	Ejnar Hertzsprung	Denmark	constitution-of-the-stars, distance-of-stars	Space	The Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung suggested that if a star's distance were known, one could calculate what magnitude it would have if it were some standard distance away. The distance chosen was 10 parsecs, or 32.6 light-years. The brightness of the star at that distance would then be its absolute magnitude.		
planetesimal-hypothesis	1905	Planetesimal hypothesis	The Planetesimal Hypothesis suggested the Solar System formed from material pulled from the Sun by a passing star, forming planetesimals that coalesced into planets. It accounted for the concentration of angular momentum in the planets. If true, there would be very few planets in the universe, since the close approach of two stars is so rare.	Thomas Crowder Chamberlin and Forest Ray Moulton	United States	nebular-hypothesis	Space	Laplace's nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System had held sway for a century, even though astronomers had grown steadily more dubious about it. It turned out that most of the angular momentum in the Solar System was concentrated in the planets. Thomas Crowder Chamberlin and Forest Ray Moulton advanced the suggestion that the Solar System began when the Sun, already in existence, passed near another star. This hypothesis retained popularity for nearly half a century.		
metabolic-intermediate	1905	Metabolic intermediate	Metabolic intermediates (or metabolites) are an intermediate or end product of metabolism. In this discovery, an enzyme's activity was sustained with the addition of inorganic phosphate. This showed the importance of phosphate groups in metabolism, and other metabolites were soon discovered.	Arthur Harden	England	gastric-digestion, coenzyme	Science: Biochemistry	Harden showed that when inorganic phosphate was added to the solution, the enzyme continued working. The sugar phosphate formed was a metabolic intermediate.		
hormones	1905	Hormones	The term hormone was introduced, proposing they are produced by small glands and that more hormones will be found. This later proved correct.	Ernest Henry Starling	England	secretin	Science: Physiology	In 1905, the name hormone was suggested and it was proposed that various small glands produce hormones in the body and that more hormones would be discovered.		
linkage-of-characteristics	1905	Linkage of characteristics	Mendel's research on heredity revealed that characteristics are inherited independently, and chromosomes were identified as the carriers of these factors. Bateson suggested that a chromosome was a collection of factors, a crucial idea for genetics. Bateson also coined the term genetics.	William Bateson	England	animal-inheritance, chromosome	Science: Genetics	Mendel's studies on pea plants showed characteristics were inherited independently. However, Sutton pointed out that chromosomes were Mendel's factors.		
higher-pressure	1905	Higher pressure	Bridgman developed a better high-pressure apparatus by inventing a tighter seal, attaining pressures of 20,000 atmospheres.	Percy Williams Bridgman	United States	high-pressure	Science: Physics	Percy Williams Bridgman designed sealed vessels capable of withstanding high pressures to produce high temperatures.		
intelligence-quotient	1905	Intelligence quotient	Tests designed to measure the ability of the human mind to think and reason were created, leading to the development of the concept of intelligence quotient (IQ). The IQ represents the ratio of mental age to chronological age, and Binet's work laid the foundation for various psychological assessments.	Alfred Binet	France	experimental-psychology	Science: Psychology	While abnormal psychological phenomena have long interested physicians and scientists, the normal manifestations of the mind were what interested the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857-1911). He strove to devise tests that would measure the ability of the human mind to think and reason, independently of learning and education in one field or another. To do this, he asked children to name objects, follow commands, rearrange disordered things, copy designs, and so on. In 1905 he and his associates published the first batteries of tests designed to measure intelligence. Standards were set empirically. If a particular test was passed by some 70 percent or so of the nine-year-olds in the Paris school system, then it represented the nine-year-old level of intelligence. The phrase intelligence quotient (often abbreviated IQ) became popular. It represents the ratio of the mental age to the chronological age, with 100 considered average. Thus, a six-year-old who can pass a ten-year-old’s test has an IQ of 10/6 x 100, or 167. Binet’s initial efforts gave rise to batteries of tests designed to measure personalities, attitudes, aptitudes, and potentialities as well as intelligence—and their value is almost certainly overestimated.		
radio-waves-and-sound	1906	Radio waves and sound	Radio communication evolved from just transmitting Morse code to sending continuous signals containing sound information. This was achieved through amplitude modulation, allowing radios to transmit and receive sound waves.	Reginald Aubrey Fessenden	United States	radio, telephone	Science: Physics	Radio communication first came into use only as a wireless telegraph, forming the dots and dashes of the Morse code in appropriate bursts of radio waves. It occurred to the Canadian-born American physicist Reginald Aubrey Fessenden (1866-1932) to send out a continuous signal with an amplitude (the height of the waves) varying in such a way as to follow the irregularities of sound waves. The radio wave was said to have amplitude modulation (AM) imposed on it. At the receiving end, the modulation could be reconverted into sound waves, with the result that you could use a radio for speaking and hearing thanks to modulated radio waves the same way you could use a telephone for speaking and hearing thanks to modulated electric currents. On December 24, 1906, the first such message was sent out from the Massachusetts coast, and wireless receivers picked up music.		
triode	1906	Triode	The triode extended the function of the rectifying diode by adding a grid, allowing for amplification of electronic signals. It facilitated improvements in radio transmission and other electronic processes.	Lee De Forest	United States	electronic-rectifier	Science: Physics	The rectifying diode worked out by Fleming (see 1904) was a useful tool but limited in its range. That range was extended in 1906 by the American inventor Lee De Forest (1873-1961). He inserted a third element, called a grid, into the tube to make it a triode (three electrodes). The grid is an electrode with holes in it, so that electrons can move from the hot filament through the holes of the grid to the plate. Even a weak charge placed on the grid can have a relatively enormous effect on the electron current. It can increase the intensity of the current if the grid is slightly positively charged, since it then attracts electrons from the heated filament; and it can decrease the intensity if slightly negatively charged, since it then repels electrons. By placing a small varying charge on the grid, you get a much larger variation in the electron flow. A triode therefore acts as an amplifier, and it can be modified to perform a great variety of tasks. Radio became more than ever adapted to the transmission of sound through Fessenden's modulation (see above).		
trojan-asteroids	1906	Trojan asteroids	An asteroid was found in Jupiter's orbit, which moved unusually slowly and held a stable gravitational position very far from Jupiter. This made it a 'Trojan' asteroid. This discovery confirmed the theoretical work predicting stable gravitational triangles in space.	Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf	Germany	asteroid-photography	Space	By 1906, no fewer than 587 asteroids had been spotted (thanks to Wolf's photographic technique—see 1891) and had their orbits calculated. In 1906 Wolf discovered an asteroid that moved unusually slowly and must therefore be unusually distant. In fact it moved in Jupiter's orbit at the outer extreme of the asteroid belt, keeping step with Jupiter at a distance of 60 degrees. This meant that the Sun, Jupiter, and the new asteroid were located at the vertices of a vast equilateral triangle. Lagrange (see 1788) had shown back in 1772 that such an arrangement was gravitationally stable, but this was the first case of such a gravitational triangle that had been actually found in space. Wolf named the asteroid Achilles, after the hero of Homer's Iliad, the tale of the		
alpha-particles	1906	Alpha particles	Beta rays were identified as streams of speeding electrons and gamma rays as electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than X-rays. By firing alpha particles at glass and observing the resultant gas, Rutherford confirmed that alpha particles were related to, but not identical to, helium atoms.	Ernest Rutherford and Johannes Hans Wilhelm Geiger	England and Germany	alpha-rays-and-beta-rays	Science: Physics	By now it was understood that beta rays were streams of speeding electrons (beta particles), while gamma rays were electromagnetic radiation of still shorter wavelength and higher frequency than X rays. The nature of the alpha particles that made up the alpha rays remained to be determined. In 1906 Rutherford (see 1897), working with a German assistant, Johannes Hans Wilhelm Geiger (1882–1945), managed to determine the ratio of the electric charge to the mass in the case of the alpha particles. This ratio turned out to be equal to that in a helium atom from which two electrons had been removed. Later Rutherford fired alpha particles at a double wall of glass with a vacuum between. The alpha particles had energy enough to penetrate the first partition but, in the process of penetration, lost so much energy that they were unable to penetrate the second. They therefore remained in the vacuum between, and after enough had accumulated, Rutherford found that the thin gas that had appeared in the vacuum was indeed helium, judging from the spectrum. Alpha particles and helium were thus related, but not identical. After all, streams of helium atoms would not penetrate glass.		
characteristic-x-rays	1906	Characteristic X rays	Barkla studied the manner in which X rays were scattered by gases and found that the higher the molecular weight of the gas, the greater the scattering of the X rays. He showed that X rays were transverse waves, and that the higher the atomic weight of the element, the more charged particles were emitted, and the more penetrating the characteristic X rays became.	Charles Glover Barkla	England	x-rays	Science: Physics	X rays had been discovered eleven years earlier and were still of profound interest to physicists. The British physicist Charles Glover Barkla (1877–1944) studied the manner in which X rays were scattered by gases and found that the higher the molecular weight of the gas, the greater the scattering of the X rays. From this he deduced, in 1904, that the more massive the atoms and molecules, the more charged particles they contained, since it was the charged particles that did the scattering. This was the first indication of a connection between the number of charged particles in an atom and its position in the periodic table. He further showed, from the manner of scattering, that X rays were transverse waves like light, not longitudinal waves like sound. This was the final proof that they were examples of electromagnetic radiation. In 1906 Barkla went on to something still more important. He showed that when X rays were scattered by particular elements, they produced a beam with a particular degree of penetration. The higher the atomic weight of an element, the more penetrating the characteristic X rays they produced. He went on to describe two types of such X rays: the more penetrating he called K radiation and the less penetrating he called L radiation. At the time it was difficult to know what to make of this, but before long, characteristic X rays were to be important in rationalizing the periodic table.		
third-law-of-thermodynamics	1906	Third law of thermodynamics	Proposed that absolute zero is a theoretical limit that cannot be reached, only approached, just like the speed of light. This principle is sometimes called the third law of thermodynamics.	Walther Hermann Nernst	Germany	solid-hydrogen, speed-of-light-interferometer	Science: Physics	By now, temperatures as low as 14 degrees above absolute zero had been reached with Dewar’s solid hydrogen (see 1898). It seemed that the race to reach absolute zero might be soon completed. In 1906, however, the German physical chemist Walther Hermann Nernst (1864-1941) advanced thermodynamic reasons for supposing that absolute zero could not be reached by any technique. He proposed that, like the speed of light in a vacuum, absolute zero was a limit that could be approached more and more closely but never actually reached. This is sometimes called the third law of thermodynamics, and for this Nernst was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1920.		
vitamin-concept	1906	Vitamin concept	The vitamin concept arose from the recognition that trace organic compounds in the diet are essential to life and can prevent diseases like scurvy and rickets. This idea significantly advanced the understanding of dietary needs and health.	Frederick Gowland Hopkins	England	dietary-deficiency-diseases	Science: Biology	Since Eijkman had found that beriberi could be cured by dietary means (see 1896), biochemists had become aware of other examples of dietary-deficiency diseases. Hopkins (see 1900) was convinced that various organic compounds were present in the diet that were essential to life but needed only in tiny quantities. In 1906 he made this point in a lecture and suggested that scurvy and rickets were two diseases that arose through the lack of trace substances. When these trace substances became known as vitamins a few years later, Hopkins was given credit for having helped give rise to the vitamin concept, so that he and Eijkman shared the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology in 1929.		
magnesium-and-chlorophyll	1906	Magnesium and chlorophyll	The structure of chlorophyll includes a magnesium atom, analogous to the presence of an iron atom in hemoglobin. This discovery advanced the understanding of the chemical makeup of chlorophyll and its role in plant biology.	Richard Willstätter	Germany	chlorophyll	Science: Biology	Ever since Pelletier discovered chlorophyll (see 1817), it had been understood that the substance was of the utmost importance. After all, it brought about the production of food and oxygen on which animal life, including human beings, subsisted. The chemical structure of chlorophyll was therefore of devouring interest to biochemists, but it was still poorly understood for all that. The German chemist Richard Willstätter (1872-1942), however, managed to supply a key item of information about chlorophyll structure in 1906. He showed that each chlorophyll molecule contained a magnesium atom, held in much the same way that an iron atom was held by hemoglobin. For this and for other work on plant pigments, Willstätter was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1915.		
chromatography	1906	Chromatography	Chromatography is a technique for separating mixtures of substances, particularly plant pigments, by passing them through a medium where components move at different rates. This method is crucial for biochemical analysis and purification.	Mikhail Semenovich Tsvett	Russia	synthetic-dyes	Science: Chemistry	The Russian botanist Mikhail Semenovich Tsvett (1872-1919) worked with plant pigments, which are made up of a large number of rather similar organic compounds, difficult to separate into individual substances that can be studied singly. (This is a difficulty that frequently arises in biochemistry.) In 1906 Tsvett found a convenient means of separation. He let a solution of a mixture of the pigments trickle down a tube of powdered aluminum oxide. The different substances in the pigment mixture held onto the surface of the powder particles but with different degrees of strength. As the mixture was washed downward, the substances began to separate, those holding with less strength being washed down farther.		
radioactivity-and-earth	1906	Radioactivity and earth	Dutton suggested that radioactivity in the Earth's crust generated heat, contributing to volcanic activity and significantly impacting the Earth's thermal history. He also devised methods to determine earthquake depth and wave velocity, helping to understand the Earth's deep interior.	Clarence Edward Dutton	United States	earth-heat, radioactive-energy	Science: Geology	In 1906 the American geologist Clarence Edward Dutton (1841–1912) suggested that pockets of radioactivity in the Earth's crust delivered enough heat over time to activate volcanic action. This was the beginning of the understanding that radioactivity added substantial heat to the Earth's crust, enough to balance that lost by radiation, so that any attempt to judge the Earth's age by calculating the time it took Earth to "cool down" from an initial high temperature was far off base. Earth could be billions of years old and still retain a heated interior. Dutton also developed methods for determining the depth of earthquake origins and the velocity with which earthquake waves traveled through the Earth. This opened the way for a technique that finally offered strong evidence concerning the physical and chemical nature of the Earth's deep interior.		
radioactive-dating	1907	Radioactive dating	Boltwood concluded that lead was the final product in the radioactive decay series beginning with uranium and thorium. This understanding paved the way for the development of radioactive dating methods to determine the age of geological samples.	Bertram Borden Boltwood	United States	radioactive-series	Science: Chemistry	Once it was understood that radioactivity involved the change of uranium or thorium to some other radioactive atom, which then broke down into still another, and so on (see 1900, Atomic Change, and 1902, Radioactive Series), the question that naturally arose was, Where did it all end? The American chemist Bertram Borden Boltwood (1870–1927) was convinced that lead was the final product of the radioactive series that began with uranium and thorium. As early as 1905 he had noted that lead.		
lutetium	1907	Lutetium	The rate of discovery of elements had been falling off, but there was room for another rare earth, the fourteenth known.	George Urbain	France	rare-earths	Science: Chemistry			
synthetic-peptides	1907	Synthetic peptides	Up to now, it was assumed that the amino group of one amino acid combined with the acid group of another. Now this was proven because a peptide chain 18 amino acids long was synthesized in a lab, and matched the properties of the naturally peptide.	Emil Hermann Fischer	Germany	protein, organic-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	It was well known that protein molecules were built up out of amino acids, but it was not known in just what manner those amino acids connected with each other. It seemed most likely that the amino group of one amino acid combined with the acid group of another, but that was not certain. In 1907, however, Fischer, who had determined the structure of sugar molecules (see 1884), combined amino acids by chemical techniques that insured a combination between the amino group of one amino acid and the acid group of the next. He continued this until he had built up a chain consisting of eighteen amino acids. He compared such a chain with those resulting from the breakdown of protein molecules by digestive enzymes. The fragments of a protein molecule so obtained are called peptides, from the Greek word for 'to digest.' Fischer found that his synthetic peptides matched the properties of the natural peptides obtained from protein in all important ways. Indeed, the synthetic peptides could also be broken down by digestive enzymes. The basic structure of the protein molecule was thus known. What remained was to determine the precise order of amino acids in given protein molecules, but that was not to happen for another half century.		
chemotherapy	1907	Chemotherapy	Using the concept that synthetic dyes could combine with some parts of a cell, but not others, Ehrlich theorized that a dye could be made to kill only the target pathogen cells and not human cells. He found a dye called "Trypan red" which targeted trypanosomes, a type of protozoa that caused sleeping sickness.	Paul Ehrlich	Germany	chromatin	Science: Medicine	The medieval alchemists had attempted to cure disease by the use of various chemicals. They were not truly successful (except occasionally by accident), because they did not know the cause of disease and had no way of testing particular chemicals in a rational manner before using them. Their techniques were largely abandoned, therefore. The German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) returned to the notion of chemical cures (he coined the word chemotherapy in this connection) on a much more knowledgeable basis. It was understood, thanks to the work of Fleming (see 1882), that synthetic dyes could combine with some parts of cells and not others and could more markedly affect some cells than others. It occurred to Ehrlich that if a dye could be found that combined with some pathogenic organism but not		
fruit-flies	1907	Fruit flies	Fruit flies were used to study genetic inheritance, leading to the discovery of linked and independent inheritance. Fruit flies have only four chromosomes pairs in each cell, are simple to feed, and breed often. Using them in research greatly hastened the pace at which knowledge of genetic mechanisms increased.	Thomas Hunt Morgan	United States	animal-inheritance	Science: Genetics	In 1907, however, the American geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866–1945) began to use a tiny insect called Drosophila, or fruit fly. They have only four chromosome pairs in each cell, are simple to feed, and breed readily and copiously at brief intervals. In studying them, Morgan found that there were characteristics that were linked and inherited together, but that the linkage was not necessarily permanent. Every once in a while, two characteristics that had previously been inherited together were suddenly inherited independently. He was able to correlate this with the fact that chromosomes sometimes interchanged parts so that two characters ordinarily on the same chromosome came to be on different chromosomes. Fruit fly research greatly hastened the pace at which knowledge of genetic mechanisms increased. For his work with them, Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1933.		
tissue-culture	1907	Tissue culture	Tadpole tissue was kept alive and Harrison found that nerve fibers grew from it. He was able to study the protoplasmic movements within the fibers, and this served as the foundation for later studies on nerve physiology.	Ross Granville Harrison	United States		Science: Biology	If intact animals are hard to study, might it be possible to take small sections of tissues and keep them alive and growing? In this way, it might be possible to study the growth, development, and functioning of cells, as well as changes in their organization. Eventually, this technique offered a method for the cultivation and study of microorganisms that would not grow on grosser, simpler media. The first to culture tissues successfully was an American zoologist, Ross Granville Harrison (1870–1959). He cultivated tadpole tissue and found that nerve fibers grew from it. He was able to study the protoplasmic movements within the fibers, and this served as the foundation for later studies on nerve physiology.		
conditioned-response	1907	Conditioned response	Unconditioned responses happen automatically through hormones, for example salivation at the sight of food. Conditioned response involves creating a new behavioral pattern by associating an unrelated stimulus with a natural reaction. As an example of conditioned response, Pavlov trained dogs to salivate in response to the ringing of a bell.	Ivan Pavlov	Russia	secretin	Science: Psychology	Salivation at the sight of food is an unconditioned response. It is brought about by the construction of the nerve network with which the organism is born. In 1907 Pavlov (see 1902) began an attempt to see if he could impose a new pattern upon such inborn ones. Thus, a hungry dog that is shown food will salivate. If a bell is made to ring every time the dog is shown food, the dog will eventually salivate when the bell rings even when food is not shown. The dog has associated the sound of the bell with the sight of food and reacts to the first as though it were the second. This is a conditioned response. Studies of the conditioned response led to the thought that a good part of learning and of the development of behavior is the		
space-time	1907	Space-time	Minkowski demonstrated that relativity requires time to be considered as a fourth dimension, combining space and time into space-time. Einstein later incorporated this concept into his theories to address gravitational interactions.	Hermann Minkowski	Germany	special-relativity	Science: Physics	Einstein's theory of special relativity (see 1905) forced many physicists to reconsider their view of the Universe. It was clear from Einstein's work that an ordinary three-dimensional view of the Universe was insufficient. The Russian-born German mathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909) published Time and Space in 1907. In it he demonstrated that relativity made it necessary to take time into account as a kind of fourth dimension (treated mathematically somewhat differently from the three spatial dimensions). Neither space nor time had existed separately, in Minkowski's view, so that the Universe consisted of a fused space-time. Einstein adopted this notion as he continued to work on his theories. He was trying to extend them to accelerated motion in order to take gravitational interactions into account.		
atomic-size	1908	Atomic size	Einstein's equation enabled the calculation of atomic and molecular sizes from Brownian motion. Perrin confirmed this by observing suspended particles through a microscope, relying on Einstein's equations to make his determinations. Atoms, it turned out, are about a hundred-millionth of a centimeter in diameter.	Jean-Baptiste Perrin	France	brownian-motion-atomic-size, mass-energy	Science: Physics	Einstein had devised an equation showing how one might calculate the size of atoms and molecules from Brownian motion (see 1905). In 1908 Perrin, who had shown that cathode rays consisted of particles carrying a negative electric charge (see 1895), set about making the calculation. Through a microscope, he counted the number of small particles of gum resin suspended at different heights in water. That they were suspended at all was the result of recoil from collisions with water molecules; in other words, from Brownian motion. From his observations and from Einstein’s equations, Perrin could make his determination.		
liquid-helium	1908	Liquid helium	Helium was finally liquefied at only 4°K, a significant achievement as it showed the properties of helium at temperatures just above absolute zero. Onnes reached a temperature of only 0.8 degrees above absolute zero, but even then he could not solidify Helium.	Heike Kamerlingh Onnes	Netherlands	liquid-hydrogen	Science: Physics	In 1908 the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853—1926) set about the task of liquefying helium. He built an elaborate device that would cool helium intensively by means of evaporating liquid hydrogen. When the helium had reached a very low temperature under compressed conditions, it would be allowed to expand so that it would cool still further. In this way, liquid helium was finally collected in a flask set within a larger flask of liquid hydrogen, which was in turn contained in a still larger flask of liquid air—so that the liquid helium would gain heat and vaporize only very slowly. It turned out that helium liquefied at a temperature of only 4 degrees above absolute zero. By allowing some of it to evaporate, Kamerlingh Onnes reached a temperature of only 0.8 degrees above absolute zero, but even then he could not solidify it. For his liquefaction of helium, Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1913.		
geiger-counter	1908	Geiger counter	The Geiger counter was invented to detect and record energetic particles emitted by radioactive substances. A single subatomic particle, on entering, would set off an avalanche of ionization, producing a momentary electric discharge. The clicking of such a Geiger counter gives us information that our senses cannot give us.	Johannes Hans Wilhelm Geiger	Germany	alpha-particles	Science: Physics	Rutherford, who had recently shown the relationship of alpha particles to helium (see 1906), was deeply engaged in investigations involving the energetic particles emitted by radioactive substances. His labors were made easier by the invention of a device to detect and, eventually, record such particles. The invention was that of his assistant, Geiger (see 1906), who in 1908 produced the first rather primitive version of his device. Essentially, it was a cylinder containing a gas under a high electric potential, but one not quite high enough to overcome the resistance of the gas and set up a spark of discharge. If a high-energy subatomic particle entered, it would rip some of the electrons off a gas molecule, and what was left of the molecule would be a positively charged ion, which would be pulled toward the negatively charged cathode with great energy. In the process, as a result of collisions, the ion would produce further ions, each of which would do the same. In short, a single subatomic particle, on entering, would set off an avalanche of ionization, producing a momentary electric discharge, which could be arranged to make a clicking sound. The clickings of such a Geiger counter give us information that our senses cannot give us.		
sunspots-and-magnetism	1908	Sunspots and magnetism	Astronomers learned over centuries that sunspots appear in cycles, but deeper understanding came with the realization of their magnetic properties. Spectral analysis revealed that sunspots exhibited the Zeeman effect and were subjected to strong electromagnetic fields.	George Ellery Hale	United States	sunspot-cycle, large-refracting-telescope, light-and-magnetism	Space	For some three centuries, astronomers had observed sunspots, counted them, noticed the manner in which they increased and decreased cyclically in number, but knew nothing more about them than they could see. Hale, who had invented the spectroheliograph (see 1890) and supervised the construction of the 40-inch refractor (see 1897), changed that. In 1908 he was able to show from the spectrum of sunspots that they exhibit		
rickettsia	1908	Rickettsia	A discovery that the disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever is spread by cattle ticks and caused by an agent resembling small bacterial cells. The agent, named rickettsia, is intermediate between viruses and bacteria in its nature.	Howard Taylor Ricketts	United States	filtrable-virus, bacteriology	Science: Biology	The American pathologist Howard Taylor Ricketts (1871-1910) was investigating the serious disease of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 1908 he had shown that it was spread by cattle ticks. In 1908 he finally located the pathogenic agent and found it to resemble rather small bacterial cells. It was not, however, a complete cell, capable of independent life and growth. Apparently it lacked some essential components of life, and like a virus, could only grow inside a cell, where it could make use of the cellular machinery to eke out its own deficiencies. These agents, which came to be called rickettsia, in honor of the discoverer, were therefore intermediate between viruses and bacteria.		
assembly-line	1908	Assembly line	Ford's sequence of alphabetically named prototypes eventually considered the Model T suitable for mass-production. By dividing car manufacturing into sequential tasks performed by individual workers using an assembly line, cars could be produced cheaply and efficiently, making them affordable for the general public. 	Henry Ford	United States	first-automobile, interchangeable-parts	Design	During the first twenty years of its existence, the automobile had been improved greatly and manufactured in greater numbers. It remained very largely a toy of the rich, however, rather as yachts are today. The man who changed that was the American industrialist Henry Ford (1863-1947). He had built his first automobile in 1893 and started a car-manufacturing company in 1899. His aim was to produce cars in quantity (mass production) and to make them cheaply enough to put them within reach of middle-class Americans. His key innovation came in 1908, when he thought of dividing the manufacture of cars into steps, each of which could be performed simply by a single worker. He then placed the future car on a moving belt that brought it to different workers in succession, each of whom performed the assigned task over and over, with all necessary tools and parts within reach. What started at one end of the assembly line was a mere skeleton of a car. What rolled off the other end was a complete, functioning automobile, including a gasoline supply so that it could be driven away. Ford produced a series of models identified by letters of the alphabet and finally considered the Model T suitable for mass-production. It cost only $950 to begin with, but the price dropped in succeeding years, eventually reaching a low of $290. For the first time, the average man could afford to buy a car, and the automobile age—still in full swing today—began.		
haber-process	1908	Haber process	A process that produces nitrates from atmospheric nitrogen, required to manufacture fertilizers and explosives. The method involves combining nitrogen from the air with hydrogen from water. Under high pressure and using iron as catalyst, you end up with ammonia.	Fritz Haber	Germany	nitrogen-fixation	Science: Chemistry	Nitrogen is absolutely essential to life, and also to explosives. Hellriegel had discovered that leguminous plants could fix atmospheric nitrogen and keep soil fertile (see 1886), but that was a slow process and would not suffice for the manufacture of explosives in the quantities that a war economy required. Nitrogen in its most usable form exists in nature as nitrates in the soil. Nitrates are therefore sought after, both for fertilizers and for explosives. Nitrates, however, are uniformly soluble and tend to be leached out of the soil by rainfall. One can therefore expect a reliable source of nitrates to be found chiefly in desert areas such as those in northern Chile. Germany, anticipating possible war with Great Britain, knew that British control of the seas would prevent Chilean nitrates from reaching Germany, reducing Germany's ability to wage war. The man who supplied the solution was Fritz Haber (1868-1934). In 1908 Haber finally succeeded, after years of effort, in producing ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen. In the Haber process, nitrogen, drawn from the air, is combined with hydrogen, derived from water, to form ammonia. This solved Germany’s problem.		
syphilis-treatment	1909	Syphilis	By now, Syphilis had been a dreaded STD for four centuries. Ehrlich discovered that arsphenamine could effectively treat syphilis by targeting spirochetes. This breakthrough significantly reduced the incidence of syphilis in England and France.	Paul Ehrlich	Germany	syphilis, chemotherapy	Science: Medicine	Ehrlich had won a Nobel Prize for finding a chemical that would kill trypanosomes and might therefore serve as a cure for sleeping sickness (see 1907). The chemical involved contained nitrogen, and it occurred to Ehrlich that if the similar but much more poisonous element arsenic were substituted for the nitrogen, it might prove a more effective chemotherapeutic agent. He tried every organic arsenic compound he could obtain or synthesize, and the 606th was a compound now called arsphenamine. It did not seem unusually promising as an agent against trypanosomes, but in 1909 an assistant of Ehrlich found that it was effective against spirochetes, the agents that caused syphilis. Syphilis had been a dreaded disease for four centuries, all the more so since it was spread by sexual activity so that it was considered shameful and could not be mentioned in polite society. Naturally, that just multiplied its incidence. Arsphenamine cut down the incidence of syphilis by half in England and France over the next five years, but bluenoses were not wanting who thought it a wicked invention because it encouraged 'immorality' by lessening the fear of medical consequences.		
typhus	1909	Typhus	Typhus, a contagious disease with a high mortality rate, periodically struck in epidemic form. Nicolle discovered that the body louse was responsible for spreading typhus by biting infected individuals and then others. This finding laid the groundwork for controlling typhus by removing body lice.	Charles-Jean-Henri Nicolle	France	germ-theory-of-disease	Science: Medicine	Typhus, a contagious disease with a high mortality rate, periodically struck in epidemic form. In Tunis, a French physician, Charles-Jean-Henri Nicolle (1866–1936), noted that typhus was very contagious outside the hospital but not inside. Something must happen upon entrance to the hospital, and Nicolle wondered if it might be the fact that patients' clothes were removed and that they were washed and put into clean hospital garments. Nicolle decided that the contagious agent must be connected with the old clothes, and he suspected the body louse, which exists everywhere among human beings where the chance for frequent washing of clothes and body does not exist. By 1909 he had proved the case. The body louse, by biting someone with typhus and then biting someone without it, spread the disease. This meant the disease could be controlled if some practical way could be found of removing the louse, in societies where for one reason or another washing was infrequent. That was not to come for another third of a century.		
ribose	1909	Ribose	Levene identified a five-carbon sugar molecule from nucleic acid and called it ribose. Not all nucleic acid molecules possessed it, but those that did came to be known as ribose nucleic acid (RNA).	Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene	United States	purines-and-pyrimidines, nucleic-acid	Science: Biology	Kossel had isolated the nitrogenous bases of nucleic acid (see 1885) but had not been able to go further. It was clear, though, that nitrogenous bases were not all there was in the molecule. In 1909 the Russian-born American chemist Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene (1869–1940) extracted a sugar from nucleic acid and identified it as ribose. It had a five-carbon molecule. Not all nucleic acid molecules possessed it, but those that did came to be known as ribose nucleic acid, almost invariably abbreviated as RNA.		
genes	1907	Genes	Chromosomes were found to have chains of inheritance units, and Johannsen suggested to call these units genes. The suggestion was adopted.	Wilhelm Ludvig Johannsen	Denmark	fruit-flies	Science: Biology	Thanks to the work of Morgan and his fruit flies (see 1907), it was established that chromosomes contained chains of many units of inheritance. It would obviously be convenient to have some way of referring to those units in a concise way. In 1909 the Danish botanist Wilhelm Ludvig Johannsen (1857-1927) suggested that they be called genes. The suggestion was adopted.		
tungsten-wire	1909	Tungsten wire	Edison's light bulb used carbon fibers as filaments, which were brittle and didn't last long. Metal wire would be better, and the one with the highest melting point was tungsten. Coolidge perfected a method for drawing it into fine wire.	William David Coolidge	United States	electric-light, tungsten	Science: Physics	When Edison introduced the electric light bulb (see 1879), he used carbon fibers as filaments. These were brittle, hard to handle, and didn’t last long. Obviously some sort of metal wire would be better. However, it would have to be of a metal with a high melting point so that it could withstand white-hot temperatures, and such metals were for the most part expensive, hard to draw into wires, or both. The metal with the highest melting point is tungsten, which melts at about 3410°C. It is not inordinately expensive, but it is brittle. In 1909, however, the American physicist William David Coolidge (1873-1975) managed to perfect a method of drawing tungsten into fine wires. As a result, tungsten filaments became universal in light bulbs, radio tubes, and other devices. Light bulbs lasted for considerably longer before having to be replaced, therefore, though further improvements remained to be made.		
bakelite	1909	Bakelite	Bakelite is a strong, water-resistant, and electrical insulating plastic material created by reacting phenol with formaldehyde. When he searched for a solvent for it, he couldn't find one. This discovery sparked the modern development of thermosetting plastics (ones that do not soften under heat).	Leo Hendrik Baekeland	United States	celluloid	Science: Chemistry	Hyatt's celluloid had been the first important synthetic plastic (see 1869), but in the forty years since it had been introduced, there had been no flood of additional plastics on the market. The real beginning came with the work of a Belgian-born American chemist, Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944). It often happened in organic chemistry that hard tarry residues fouled chemical equipment and then could not be removed. Baekeland tried to find some solvent that would remove them. For the purpose, he deliberately reacted phenol with formaldehyde to form such a residue, and then searched for a solvent. He couldn’t find one. It occurred to him that if the residue was so resistant to solvents, it might have a useful application in its own right as an inert, strong, and cheap material so he began to concentrate on forming the resinous mass more efficiently and making it still harder and tougher. By using the proper heat and pressure, he obtained a liquid that solidified and took the shape of the container it was in. Once solid, it was hard, water-resistant, solvent-resistant, and an electrical insulator. Yet it could be cut without trouble and was easily machined. In 1909 he brought this substance (which he named Bakelite, after himself) on the market. Bakelite was the first of the thermosetting plastics (one that once set will not soften under heat) and has been useful ever since. It sparked the modern development of plastics.		
mohorovicic-discontinuity	1910	Mohorovičić discontinuity	After an earthquake in the Balkans, it was found that deeper waves traveled faster than shallower ones, suggesting that Earth was made of multiple discontinuous layers. This sharp separation below the crust is called the Mohorovičić discontinuity.	Andrija Mohorovičić	Croatia	modern-seismograph	Science: Geology	Mohorovičić maintained that the Earth's outermost crust rested on a layer that was more rigid and in which earthquake waves therefore traveled more quickly. Furthermore, the separation between the two layers did not seem to be gradual but sharp. It was a discontinuity and came to be known as the Mohorovičić discontinuity.		
north-pole	1909	North pole	Robert Edwin Peary explored Greenland extensively and proved that it was an island which does not extend to the North Pole. Peary's party finally reached the true north pole on April 6, 1909.	Robert Edwin Peary	United States	greenland-ice-cap	Geography	The American explorer Robert Edwin Peary (1856-1920) made it his goal. Beginning in 1886, he began a detailed exploration of Greenland and in 1891 explored its northern coast (relatively ice-free and still called Peary Land in his honor). He proved that Greenland was an island that did not extend to the North Pole, although the northernmost bit of Greenland is closer to the pole than any other land area. In 1909 Peary organized an elaborate travel party, of which successive members were to turn back at periodic intervals until at the end only Peary and his black associate, Matthew Alexander Henson (1866-1955), reached the North Pole in a final dash on April 6, 1909.		
neon-lights	1910	Neon lights	Electric discharges through noble gases can produce light, particularly red light with neon. The fact that tubes filled with neon or other gases could be twisted into any shape—so that they spelled out words, made them appealing in advertisement.	Georges Claude	France	neon-krypton-xenon, cathode-rays	Science: Physics	Claude (1870-1960) showed that electric discharges through the noble gases could be made to produce light. Most spectacular was the red light produced in this manner by neon, so that light produced in this		
sex-linked-characteristics	1910	Sex-linked characteristics	The first observation of sex-linked characteristics was made using fruit flies. This discovery showed that males and females differ in their chromosome makeup, with females posessing two X chromosomes, and males just one.	Thomas Hunt Morgan	United States	chromosomes-and-inheritance, mutations	Science: Biology	In 1910 Morgan, still working with fruit flies, noted a white-eyed male among a mass of ordinary red-eyed ones. It was a mutation such as De Vries had observed among plants. Morgan crossed the white-eyed male with a red-eyed female, and all the offspring were red-eyed (red was dominant). In the next generation, however, there were both red-eyed and white-eyed flies, and all the white-eyed ones were males. This was the first observation of sex-linked characteristics. It meant that males and females had to be differentiated in chromosome makeup. The way they are is that not all the chromosomes make up perfect pairs. In the case of one of them, the female fruit fly did indeed have a pair (an X chromosome and an X chromosome), but the male had one normal chromosome and a stub (an X chromosome and a Y chromosome). A white-eye gene on the female X chromosome could be overbalanced by a red-eye gene on the pair, but a white-eye gene on the male X chromosome had nothing to balance it on the Y-chromosome stub. The chromosome pairs of male and female human beings show a similar differentiation.		
mathematics-and-logic	1910	Mathematics and logic	Russell and Whitehead published the first volume of Principia Mathematica, a work aiming to establish mathematics as a branch of logic. It was a significant achievement in the field of mathematics.	Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead	England	symbolic-logic-and-mathematics	Math	Russell and the British mathematician Alfred North Whitehead collaborated on a monumental three-volume work, Principia Mathematica, the first volume of which appeared in 1910. It was another effort to establish mathematics as a branch of logic, building all of it out of basic definitions and processes. It was the most nearly definitive accomplishment of this sort.		
nuclear-atom	1911	Nuclear atom	By firing alpha particles at a very thin gold sheet and capturing whether they were deflected, Rutherford discovered that atoms are mostly empty space with a dense nucleus at the center, confirming the nuclear model of the atom. He showed that alpha particles were helium nuclei.	Ernest Rutherford	England	alpha-particles	Science: Physics	For some years, Rutherford had been firing alpha particles at sheets of matter (see 1906), thinking that even if they could penetrate the matter, they might be deflected and scattered by the atoms making it up. From the manner of the deflection, Rutherford hoped to gain some knowledge of atomic structure. In 1908, for instance, he fired alpha particles at a sheet of gold only 1/50,000 of an inch thick. Most of the alpha particles passed through, unaffected and undeflected, recording themselves on the photographic plate behind. Since the gold represented a barrier that was two thousand atoms thick, the fact that alpha particles could pass through them all as though there were nothing there seemed to mean that atoms were mostly empty space. Yet some alpha particles were deflected, and struck the photographic plate some distance away from the central spot formed by the main stream of alpha particles. Some were deflected through quite an angle. This meant that part of the atom contained considerable mass. From the fact that so few alpha particles were deflected, it could be concluded that the part with the mass must make up a very small fraction of the atom. By 1911 Rutherford had gathered enough evidence to put forward his theory of the nuclear atom. The atom, it would seem, has virtually all its mass squeezed into a tiny, positively charged atomic nucleus (which we now know is only 1/100,000 the diameter of the atom). The outer regions of the atom contain enough electrons, each with a unit negative charge, to neutralize the nuclear charge and leave the atom as a whole electrically neutral. This theory was adopted quickly, for it answered major questions. For example, the relationship between alpha particles and helium was now understood. The alpha particles were helium nuclei, not helium atoms. This accounted for the electric charge of the alpha particle and, thanks to its subatomic size, for its penetrating power.		
cloud-chamber	1911	Cloud chamber	Wilson developed a technique for making artificial clouds in a cloud chamber to visualize energetic particles by making droplets form around ions. It became an important tool in nuclear research, aiding in the visualization of particle paths and their properties.	Charles Thomson Rees Wilson	Scotland	uranium-radiations, geiger-counter	Science: Physics	It occurred to Wilson eventually that energetic radiation would produce ions as they spread through the atmosphere. If he could prepare air that was dust-free, he could make it so moist that water drops would only be kept from condensing by lack of the dust that would serve as condensation-seeds. If an energetic particle then passed through the chamber, and if the chamber was expanded, droplets of water would form around the ions produced by the passage of the particle, and not only would the presence of the particle be detected but its route of travel as well. If the cloud chamber was then placed in a magnetic field, the curvature of the path of the particle would indicate the nature of its electric charge and give information concerning its mass. It would also indicate collisions of particles with molecules and with other particles and offer a guide to events that took place before and after the collision. Wilson perfected his cloud chamber in 1911 and it quickly became an important adjunct of nuclear research. For this work, Wilson was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 1927.		
electron-charge	1911	Electron charge	Balancing gravity against electric attraction, Millikan accurately measured the electric charge of an electron by observing oil droplets ionized by X-rays. The charge on a single electron turns out to be sixteen-quintillionths of a coulomb.	Robert Andrews Millikan	United States	electron-as-subatomic-particle	Science: Physics	The ratio of the electric charge of the electron to its mass had been worked out and compared with that of ordinary ions by Thomson (see 1897). The size of the electric charge in an absolute sense, however, was not known. The American physicist Robert Andrews Millikan (1868-1953) tackled the job. Beginning in 1906, he had followed the course of tiny electrically charged water droplets falling through air, under the influence of gravity, against the pull of a charged plate above. The evaporation of the water confused the results, and in 1911 he began to use tiny oil droplets instead. Every once in a while, such an oil droplet attached itself to an ion, which Millikan produced by passing X rays through the chamber. With the ion added, the effect of the charged plate above was suddenly strengthened and the droplet would fall more slowly or perhaps even rise. The minimum change in motion was due, Millikan felt, to the addition of a single electronic charge. By balancing the effects of the electromagnetic attraction upward and the gravitational attraction downward, both before and after such an addition, Millikan was able to calculate the charge on a single electron. The figure we now have is sixteen-quintillionths of a coulomb.		
cosmic-rays	1911	Cosmic rays	A gold-leaf electroscope detects energetic radiation by allowing the leaves to come together when ionization occurs. When this instrument was sent up into the atmosphere, the leaves came up eight times faster at large heights versus ground level, suggesting a source of radiation from the cosmos.	Victor Franz Hess	Austria	geiger-counter, scientific-ballooning, radiometer	Science: Physics	One way to detect the presence of energetic radiation is by the use of a gold-leaf electroscope. This device consists of two pieces of gold leaf, joined at the upper end, and contained in a sealed jar. They can be electrically charged from the outside, and since both leaves have the same charge, they repel each other, forming an inverted V. Any energetic radiation entering the jar produces ions, which will carry off the electric charge and allow the gold leaves to come together slowly. There seemed no way of keeping the leaves permanently apart, however, even in the absence of any known source of energetic radiation. Some radiation was apparently coming from an unknown source.		
superconductivity	1911	Superconductivity	It was known that resistance is proportional to temperature, and an experiment on very cold mercury found that by 4.2°K, its resistance was 0. This phenomenon was called superconductivity and was soon observed in some other metals.	Kamerlingh Onnes	Netherlands	liquid-helium	Science: Physics	Kamerlingh Onnes, having liquefied helium and obtained temperatures of 4 degrees above absolute zero (4° K) and even lower, was eager to study the properties of matter at such exceedingly low temperatures. For instance, it was known that metals tended to lessen their resistance to an electric current as the temperature went down. It seemed to Onnes that this lessening must continue all the way down to absolute zero, where it must disappear altogether. He tested the matter on mercury, and resistance dropped more or less as expected till he reached a temperature of 4.2° K. There, to his surprise, the resistance dropped suddenly to zero. This phenomenon—the perfect conductivity of an electric current at temperatures close to absolute zero—was called superconductivity. It was soon found that other metals (though not all) also showed the phenomenon, the resistance dropping to zero at some very low temperature that was characteristic for each metal.		
chromosome-maps	1911	Chromosome maps	Genetic mapping, refers to the method used to create genetic maps to estimate the positions of genes in chromosomes. These genetic maps are constructed by analyzing recombination patterns that occur during the crossing over of chromosomes.	Thomas Hunt Morgan and Alfred Henry Sturtevant	United States	sex-linked-characteristics	Science: Biology	Morgan had shown that chromosomes could cross over from one gene to another, which allowed them to be inherited separately where previously they had been linked, or inherited together. Obviously, the farther two genes were from each other on a particular chromosome, the greater the chance that a crossover somewhere along the chromosome would separate them. Morgan and his assistant, the American geneticist Alfred Henry Sturtevant (1891–1970), investigated the frequency of separation by crossover in an attempt to locate the genes governing particular characteristics on a chromosome. The first such chromosome map was presented in 1911.		
tumor-virus	1911	Tumor virus	Cancer is not obviously contagious, but one virus, called Rous chicken sarcoma virus (RSV) was discovered that could induce tumors in chickens after being filtered from a mashed tumor. RSV became known as the first oncogenic retrovirus that could be used to study the development of cancer molecularly.	Francis Peyton Rous	United States	filtrable-virus	Science: Medicine	Cancer, one of the most dreaded diseases, is not obviously contagious. On the other hand, it is not a single disease but a whole family of diseases involving unrestrained growth, with characteristics that may differ from one to another. An American physician, Francis Peyton Rous (1879–1970), had occasion to examine a chicken with a tumor. When it died, Rous decided to test among other things whether it might contain a virus. He was sure it didn’t but felt it wise to make sure by experiment. He mashed up the tumor and passed it through a filter fine enough to keep out anything larger than a virus. To his surprise, he found that this filtrate was infectious and would produce tumors in chickens. It was the first case of a tumor virus.		
earthquakes-and-faults	1911	Earthquakes and faults	It was known that there were faults, regions in the Earth's crust where two dissimilar sets of rock came together. A "reverse fault theory" was proposed, explaining that faults exist before earthquakes and earthquakes occur due to pressure on the fault. 	Harry Fielding Reid	United States	earthquakes	Science: Geology	The American geologist Harry Fielding Reid (1859-1944) studied the San Francisco earthquake and came to the conclusion, in 1911, that the reverse was true. The fault existed first, and the earthquake resulted when pressure upon the fault caused it to slip further. This idea has been accepted ever since.		
seaplanes	1911	Seaplanes	After becoming the first to fly a mile on an airplane in 1908, Curtis invented a practical seaplane capable of taking off and landing on water. It utilized pontoons instead of wheels.	Glenn Hammond Curtiss	United States	airplane, alloy-steel	Design	In 1911 he (Glenn Hammond Curtiss) finally built a practical seaplane, or hydroplane, with pontoons rather than wheels, that could take off and land on water.		
south-pole	1911	South pole	Inspired by prior expeditions reaching the north pole, a new expedition successfully reached the South Pole and returned safely for the first time. This achievement marked a significant milestone in exploration.	Roald Amundsen	Norway	north-pole	Geography	In October 1911 he (Roald Amundsen) set off, with dogs (who could eat meat—and each other, in case of need), reaching the South Pole on December 14 and returning safely.		
self-starter	1911	Self-starter	An electric starter for automobiles was invented, making it possible to start cars with a key rather than a crank. This innovation allowed more people to easily use and drive automobiles.	Charles Franklin Kettering	United States	first-automobile, electric-motors	Design	The American inventor Charles Franklin Kettering (1876-1958) invented an electric starter in 1911 that would do the job at the turn of a key. It was used in the 1912 Cadillac and quickly grew popular. With the crank gone, automobiles could be started and driven by far more people, which greatly spread the automobile way of life.		
cepheid-variables	1912	Cepheid variables	Cepheid variables are stars with distinct brightness patterns, named after the first such star discovered in the constellation Cepheus. Leavitt worked out a method for determining the luminosity of a Cepheid variable from its period. Once its luminosity was known, its distance could be calculated from its apparent brightness.	Henrietta Swan Leavitt	England	eclipsing-variables, southern-stars	Space	There is a group of variable stars in which the rise and fall of brightness follows a distinctive pattern, although the period—the time taken by one rise and fall—varies from star to star. These stars are called Cepheid variables because the first one discovered was in the constellation Cepheus. The American astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868-1921) was interested in Cepheid variables and studied a number of them in the Magellanic Clouds, two large groups of stars that lie beyond the Milky Way. Her observations, beginning in 1904, showed that the brighter the Cepheid, the longer the period. This fact was obscured among the stars nearer to us, because some Cepheids seem dim only because they are quite far away, while others seem bright only because they are near. In the Magellanic Clouds, however, all the Cepheids are about the same distance from us, so that their apparent brightness reflects their real brightness, or luminosity. By 1912 Leavitt had worked out a method for determining the luminosity of a Cepheid variable from its period. Once its luminosity was known, its distance could be calculated from its apparent brightness. What was needed to make this method work was a reliable estimate, by some other method, of the absolute distance of at least one Cepheid variable. This was a knotty problem, for even the nearest Cepheid is too far away for its absolute distance to be determined easily. Once this was accomplished, however, the Cepheid variables could be used as a yardstick to determine distances far greater than those that could be determined by the method of parallax.		
nebular-velocities	1912	Nebular velocities	Up to now, the Andromeda nebula remained a puzzle to astronomers, since no stars could be discerned within the cloud. By studying its spectrum, Slipher determined that it was approaching Earth at aspeed of 125 miles per second, and determined the radial velocities of other nebulae.	Vesto Melvin Slipher	United States	andromeda-nebula	Space	The Andromeda nebula, which had first been observed telescopically exactly three centuries before, was still rather a puzzle for astronomers. It seemed to be a cloud of dust and gas to the eye, but its light was similar to starlight in characteristics, even though no stars were visible within it. One thing that could be done was to study its spectrum and, from the position of its dark lines, see whether it was approaching us or receding from us. The American astronomer Vesto Melvin Slipher (1875-1969) made the measurement in 1912 and reported that it was approaching Earth at a speed of 125 miles per second. This did not seem very important at the time, but Slipher went on to determine the radial velocities of other nebulae, and such results led, in the next decades, to the discovery of the expanding universe.		
continental-drift	1912	Continental drift	As soon as the shoreline of South America had been mapped 350 years before, people noticed that it and Africa could fit neatly if they were moved together. Wegener proposed that the two had once been attached but broke in two due to continental drift, and that all continents were once a single landmass he called Pangaea, surrounded by Panthalassa.	Alfred Lothar Wegener	Germany	amazon-river	Science: Geology			
x-ray-diffraction	1912	X-ray diffraction	The standard method for measuring wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation was to use a fine grating, but X-rays have very short wavelengths and there was no grating fine enough. Instead, Laue used a crystal instead and captured its diffraction pattern on a photographic plate.	Max Theodor Felix von Laue	Germany	characteristic-x-rays, dry-plates	Science: Physics	In 1912 Laue tried the experiment of passing X rays through a crystal of zinc sulfide and recording the diffraction pattern on a photographic plate. It worked perfectly. It was clear that such a diffraction pattern could be used to calculate X-ray wavelengths, and that once the wavelengths were known, the technique could be used to study the fine structure of crystals. For his work on X-ray diffraction, Laue was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1914.		
neon-varieties	1912	Neon varieties	Thomson studied how positively charged subatomic particles were deflected by magnetic and electric fields and where they landed on a photographic plate. He discovered two varieties of neon atoms differing in charge, mass, or both, foreshadowing new concepts of atomic structure.	Joseph John Thomson	England	canal-rays, nuclear-atom, dry-plates	Science: Physics	Thomson (see 1897) found himself interested in the canal rays that Goldberg had discovered a quarter-century earlier (see 1886). By 1912 it was clear that they were composed of positively charged subatomic particles, so Thomson called them positive rays. In the light of Rutherford's nuclear atom (see 1911), the positive rays appeared to be streams of atomic nuclei. In 1912 Thomson studied the manner in which positive rays were deflected by magnetic and electric fields. He balanced those fields in such a way that particles of different charge-to-mass ratio curved differently and fell in different spots on a photographic plate. When he deflected streams of neon nuclei, he found to his surprise that they landed on two different spots, as though there were two varieties of neon atom that differed in charge, mass, or both. Observations such as this were soon to introduce new concepts of atomic structure that proved to be of the greatest importance.		
dipole-moments	1912	Dipole moments	The concept of dipole moments involves the distribution of electrons in molecules, leading to polar and nonpolar molecules with different behaviors in electric fields, with polar molecules featuring higher melting and boiling points because of additional electrical attraction. Debye's equations greatly advanced the understanding of molecular behavior.	Peter Joseph William Debye	Netherlands	atomic-structure	Science: Chemistry	Now that it was understood that electrons formed part of atoms, it followed that when atoms joined to form molecules, electrons ought to be distributed over the various atoms of the molecules. Such distribution might be symmetrical, so that the molecule was electrically uncharged, or unsymmetrical, so that one part of the molecule might have a surplus of electrons and thus a slight negative charge while another part might have a deficit of electrons and a slight positive charge. These would represent positive and negative poles of the molecules, which would thus be polar molecules, or molecular dipoles. Naturally polar molecules and nonpolar molecules would act differently with respect to electric fields. In addition, polar molecules would attract each other, positive toward negative, and therefore have higher melting and boiling points than nonpolar molecules of similar size. In 1912 a Dutch physical chemist, Peter Joseph William Debye (1884–1966), worked out a set of equations that would represent the behavior of such polar molecules. This gave rise to the concept of dipole moments and greatly helped chemists understand how molecules behave in different conditions.		
vitamins	1912	Vitamins	Vitamins were identified as trace substances in the diet necessary to prevent diseases like beriberi and scurvy. Initially thought to contain amine groups, the term comes from vit-amines, but the e was dropped to dilute the reference.	Casimir Funk	Poland	vitamin-concept	Science: Biology	The Polish-born biochemist Casimir Funk (1884–1967) strongly supported the notion advanced six years earlier by Hopkins (see 1906) that diseases such as beriberi, scurvy, pellagra, and rickets were caused by the absence of vital trace substances in the diet. It was Funk’s notion (an erroneous one) that such substances contained amine groups (combinations of a nitrogen atom and two hydrogen atoms), and he therefore called the trace substances vitamines (Latin for “life-amines”). When it turned out a few years later that not all such substances contained amine groups, the e was dropped to dilute the reference and the substances became known as vitamins.		
coal-hydrogenation	1912	Coal hydrogenation	Bosch improved the Haber process and made it more industrially scalable. Then Bosch and Bergius developed an analogous process for hydrogenating coal and heavy oil to produce gasoline.	Carl Bosch and Friedrich Bergius	Germany	haber-process	Science: Chemistry	The Haber process for hydrogenating nitrogen to form ammonia (see 1908) set off a flurry of activity. The German chemist Carl Bosch (1874–1940) improved the process and supervised the construction of large plants to make use of it. In 1912 another German chemist, Friedrich Bergius (1884–1949), applied the principles in treating coal and heavy oil with hydrogen to form gasoline. For their work on high-pressure processes, Bosch and Bergius shared the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1931.		
isotopes	1913	Isotopes	By now fifty radioactive elements had been reported, but the periodic table only had space for about ten to twelve. Soddy suggested the radioactive displacement law: an atom that gives off an alpha or beta particle must change into a different substance. Isotopes are forms of the same element with equal nuclear charge but different masses, distinguished by their radioactive properties. Thus multiple substances could share one spot in the periodic table.	Frederick Soddy	England	periodic-table-of-the-elements, alpha-rays-and-beta-rays	Science: Chemistry	During the intense study of radioactive phenomena that had been going on for the previous seventeen years, some forty to fifty different elements had been reported (as judged by differences in radioactive properties—the kinds, intensities, and energies of particles emitted). However, there were only ten to twelve places available for them in the periodic table. Either the periodic table did not apply to radioactive elements or there was something subtle about those elements that had been missed. The British chemist Frederick Soddy (1877–1956) worked on the problem. He made clear what is now called the radioactive displacement law. (The Polish chemist Kasimir Fajans (1887–1975) made these same suggestions independently at about the same time.) When an atom gives off an alpha particle, the alpha particle has a positive charge of 2 and a mass of 4. The atom that gave it off therefore has to turn into another atom with a smaller charge (by 2) on its nucleus and a smaller mass (by 4). When a beta particle is given off, with a negative charge of 1, the loss of the negative charge is equivalent to the gain of a positive charge. An atom that gives off a beta particle therefore turns into another atom with a larger nuclear charge (by 1). Since an electron has only a tiny mass, the mass of an atom is virtually unchanged in beta-particle emission. A gamma ray, having neither electric charge nor mass, does not affect the nature of an atom when given off; it merely decreases the atom’s energy content. By following these changes, Soddy suggested that a given place in the periodic table might be occupied by two or more different substances, distinguishable from each other by their differing radioactive properties. These occupants of the same place would be equal in nuclear charge but different in mass. Soddy called them isotopes, from Greek words meaning “same place.” For his advancement of the isotope concept, Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1921.		
lead-isotopes	1913	Lead isotopes	Because of the radioactive displacement law, uranium and thorium both break down into different isotopes of lead. This was experimentally confirmed using unprecedentedly accurate methods for measuring weight, providing evidence for the isotope concept.	Theodore William Richards	United States	isotopes	Science: Chemistry	Soddy had worked out the isotope concept in connection with radioactive elements, but these were available in such tiny quantities that atomic weights could not be determined, and the existence of isotopes could not be checked in that way. However, the radioactive displacement law made it clear that uranium and thorium each broke down to a different isotope of lead, and that could be checked. The American chemist Theodore William Richards (1868–1928) had worked out unprecedentedly accurate methods for determining atomic weights, and he used these methods to determine the atomic weight of lead obtained from ores containing uranium or thorium and those containing neither. In 1913 Richards found definite variations in the atomic weight of lead, and this strongly supported the isotope concept. For his work...		
quantized-atom	1913	Quantized atom	Bohr theory modified the atomic structure model by suggesting that electrons are quantized. They move in fixed, perfectly circular orbits and not anywhere in between,	Niels Bohr	Denmark	nuclear-atom, spectral-lines-and-elements	Science: Physics			
coolidge-tube	1913	Coolidge tube	Using a block of tungsten as an anode in a cathode-ray tube, Coolidge was able to produce X rays. This made it easier and more efficient to produce X rays, enabling their use in industry, medicine, and dentistry.	William David Coolidge	United States	tungsten-wire	Science: Chemistry			
nitrogen-filled-light-bulbs	1913	Nitrogen-filled light bulbs	The development of nitrogen-filled light bulbs reduced evaporation and extended their lifespan. Argon later replaced nitrogen for efficiency. The presence of gas also made the bulb less prone to shattering on impact, increasing safety.	Irving Langmuir	United States	tungsten-wire	Design	Even with the use of Coolidge’s tungsten filaments (see above), light bulbs were not immortal. The high-melting tungsten wire slowly vaporized at the temperatures required to produce adequate light. The filament thinned and eventually broke.The American chemist Irving Langmuir (1881–1957) argued that by keeping hot metal in a vacuum, vaporization was encouraged, but the presence of gas pressure would cut down the rate. Naturally, one couldn’t use air, for then the tungsten would burn, but why not use pure nitrogen? Nitrogen-filled bulbs did indeed decrease the rate of evaporation and provide longer-lasting light bulbs.  Eventually, argon was used in place of nitrogen. Hot tungsten reacted slowly even with nitrogen, but not at all with the just about totally inert argon. The use of gas in light bulbs was also a safety measure. If light bulbs were accidentally dropped, the breakage was not as shattering when there was gas pressure inside as when there was a vacuum. 		
stark-effect	1913	Stark effect	The Stark Effect shows how strong electric fields multiply spectral lines, analogous to the Zeeman effect involving magnetic fields. 	Johannes Stark	Germany	light-and-magnetism	Science: Physics	In 1913 the German physicist Johannes Stark (1874–1957) demonstrated that strong electric fields caused a multiplication in spectral lines. The Stark effect was the analog of the Zeeman effect involving magnetic fields (see 1896). For this finding, Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1919.		
magellanic-cloud-distances	1913	Magellanic cloud distances	The distance to the Magellanic Clouds was first calculated using the period-luminosity law and measurements of Cepheid variables to be something over 150,000 light years away. This was the first distance estimate to any object outside the Milky Way Galaxy.	Ejnar Hertzsprung	Denmark	cepheid-variables, distance-of-stars	Space	In 1913 Hertzsprung, who had earlier noted the difference between red giant stars and red dwarf stars (see 1905), was able to work out the actual distances of some Cepheid variables. Once he had done this, he could make use of Leavitt’s period-luminosity law, worked out the previous year (see 1912), to determine the distances of Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds and therefore the distance of the Magellanic Clouds themselves. This distance proved to be something over 150,000 light-years.		
ozonosphere	1913	Ozonosphere	Significant quantities of ozone in the upper atmosphere (between 6 and 30 miles) were discovered and termed the ozonosphere. This layer is crucial for absorbing and blocking ultraviolet radiation.	Charles Fabry	France	ozone	Science: Chemistry	Although oxygen is a major component of Earth’s atmosphere, the three-atom molecule ozone (see 1840) is not found in more than trace amounts in the air around us. That is just as well, of course, for it is poisonous. In 1913, however, the French physicist Charles Fabry (1867–1945) was able to demonstrate the presence of significant quantities of ozone in the upper atmosphere, between heights of 6 and 30 miles. This region is sometimes called the ozonosphere in consequence. There, the ozone is extremely useful, for it absorbs and blocks the more energetic ultraviolet. 		
vitamins-a-and-b	1913	Vitamins A and B	One suspected vitamin was essential to life and found in some fats, it had to be different from the one that cured beri-beri. Initially code named A and B, they were eventually renamed vitamin A and B. Following the same convention, the one for curing scurvy was called C.	Elmer Verner McCollum	United States	vitamins, dietary-deficiency-diseases, scurvy	Science: Biology	As research on vitamins continued, it became clear that there were several of them. The American biochemist Elmer Verner McCollum (1879–1967) found, in 1913, that there was some factor essential to life in some fats. It had to be fat-soluble, and this alone had to make its molecular structure considerably different from the trace substance, essential to life, that cured beriberi, since that was water-soluble. In the absence of any real information about the molecular structure of these compounds, McCollum called them fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Eventually, this was changed to vitamin A and vitamin B.		
michaelis-menten-equation	1913	Michaelis-menten equation	An equation describing the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions was derived, explaining how reaction rates varied with substrate concentration. To be metaphorical, the catalyst played the part of a hard flat surface in the writing of a note; it's difficult to write on a piece of paper in the air, but place the paper on a desk and writing becomes easy.	Leonor Michaelis, Maud Lenora Menten	Germany	catalysis	Science: Chemistry	The German chemist Leonor Michaelis (1875–1949) and his assistant Maud Lenora Menten derived an equation that would describe the rate at which enzyme-catalyzed reactions took place. In order to do that, they supposed that the enzyme combined with the substance whose reaction it catalyzed and that after the reaction took place the two separated again. This supposition allowed the Michaelis-Menten equation to be derived, which showed how the rate of reaction varied with the concentration of the substance undergoing the reaction.		
glycolysis	1913	Glycolysis	A method to measure the heat changes due to muscle contraction was developed using thermocouples, which generated current in response to changes in heat. This allowed detection of temperature changes as small as 0.003 °C over 0.001 s.	Archibald Vivian Hill	England	seebeck-effect	Science: Biology	The British physiologist Archibald Vivian Hill (1886–1977) was particularly interested in the relationship between muscle contraction and heat development. To measure the small and transient heat effects, he made use of thermocouples, which swiftly and delicately recorded heat changes in the form of tiny electric currents. He refined his methods till he could measure a rise of three-thousandths of a degree for a few hundredths of a second.		
atomic-number	1914	Atomic number	It was now possible to measure the wavelengths of elements' characteristic X rays. It was found that the higher the weight of the element, the higher the frequency of the characteristic X ray. This led to a major improvement of the periodic table, with the amount of positive charge on the nucleus now called the atomic number.	Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley	England	x-ray-diffraction, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Physics	Once Laue had shown that X rays could be diffracted by crystals (see 1912) and Barkla had shown that elements could be made to emit characteristic X rays (see 1906), it became possible to measure the wavelengths of those characteristic X rays precisely by crystal diffraction. This work was done by the British physicist Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (1887–1915), who completed it in 1914. He showed that the characteristic X rays decreased in wavelength and increased in frequency with the increasing weight of the elements emitting them. This Moseley attributed to the increasing positive charge on the atomic nucleus as the atomic weight of the element increased. This discovery led to a major improvement of Mendeleyev’s periodic table (see 1869).		
x-ray-wavelength	1914	X-ray wavelength	A father and son team worked out the mathematical details involved in diffraction of X rays. They showed relationships between the wavelength of the X-ray, its angle of incidence, and the distance between the atomic layers inside the crystal. This provided a powerful tool for studying crystals' structures.	William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg	England	x-ray-diffraction	Science: Physics	Laue’s discovery of X-ray diffraction by crystals (see 1912) led almost at once to efforts to determine the wavelengths of X rays by this method. This was accomplished by a father-and-son team of British physicists, William Henry Bragg (1862–1942) and William Lawrence Bragg (1890–1971). They worked out the mathematical details involved in the diffraction and showed how to calculate wavelengths from it. As a result, the two Braggs were awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1915.		
ions-and-crystals	1914	Ions and crystals	Sodium chloride and similar compounds existed a molecule in liquid form, but as arrays of ions in solid form. This geometric regularity was maintained by interactions of electromagnetic forces.	William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg	England	ionic-dissociation, x-ray-diffraction	Science: Chemistry	Thirty years earlier Arrhenius had advanced the notion that electrolytes in solution dissociated into ions (see 1884). The idea was that a substance such as sodium chloride existed in solid form as a molecule, symbolized as NaCl, but on solution split up into the positively charged sodium ion (Na+) and the negatively charged chloride ion (Cl-). When the Braggs were studying X-ray diffraction, however (see above), they found that that phenomenon could best be understood if it was supposed that in a solid crystal of sodium chloride there were no intact molecules, merely sodium ions and chloride ions positioned with geometric regularity. Sodium chloride and many other compounds did not exist as molecules in the older sense, then, but as arrays of ions held together by electromagnetic interaction.		
beta-particle-energies	1914	Beta-particle energies	By now it was known that alpha particles are emitted with several different discrete energy levels. Chadwick discovered that beta particles came off in a continuous range of energies, from zero to a determined maximum. This puzzle would remain unexplained for a number of years.	James Chadwick	England	alpha-particles	Science: Physics	If a particular atom broke down to emit an alpha or beta particle, it would seem that a definite energy source had been broached, and particles of definite energies ought to be given off. As early as 1904, W. H. Bragg (see above), studying radium, had shown that alpha particles were emitted with several different sharply delineated ranges. Presumably there were several different processes going on within the radium nucleus, and each gave off alpha particles of a particular energy. In 1914, however, the English physicist James Chadwick (1891–1974) showed that beta particles also were emitted with definite energies as well.		
proton	1914	Proton	Rutherford suggested that positive rays involving hydrogen nuclei were the smallest existing positively charged particles in existence. He reasoned that the nucleus of an atom consists of protons, but because they are positively charged, also needed electrons to neutralize the protons. 	Ernest Rutherford	England	neon-varieties, prouts-hypothesis	Science: Physics	Thomson felt that positive rays consisted of streams of high-velocity atomic nuclei...		
main-sequence	1914	Main sequence	The Main Sequence is a relationship between the brightness and temperature of stars, showing a continuous band on a graph in which most stars reside. It explains that 95 percent of the stars, including red dwarfs, steadily dim as they grow older.	Henry Norris Russell	United States	color-and-stellar-luminosity	Space	Hertzsprung had noted that some red stars were giants...		
white-dwarfs	1914	White dwarfs	The dim companion star to Sirius, known as Sirius B, was found to be a white dwarf, about the mass of the sun but the size of earth and "white hot". Just like a dense atomic nucleus, stars could be extremely dense and small, challenging previous stellar theories such as the Main Sequence.	Walter Sydney Adams	United States	dim-companion-of-sirius, nuclear-atom	Space	A star that didn't fit into the Main Sequence (see above) was the dim companion of Sirius, which had first been postulated by Bessel (see 1844) and first observed by Clark just over half a century before (see 1862). From the strength of the companion's attraction to Sirius, the companion had to be about the mass of the Sun. At the distance of Sirius, a star with the mass of the Sun that was as dim as the companion was should be very cool indeed and therefore red in color. Yet the companion didn't seem to be red, but white. The American astronomer Walter Sydney Adams (1876–1956) managed to get its spectrum in 1914, despite the blaze of nearby Sirius. The companion turned out to be a hot star, as hot as Sirius and hotter than our Sun. To be our Sun's mass and to be hotter than the Sun, too, the companion should have been blazing out as a first-magnitude star, but it wasn't. In fact it is too dim to see without a telescope. The only way of explaining that was to suppose that Sirius's companion was a very small star, more nearly the size of the Earth than of the Sun—even though it had the mass of the Sun. Had the discovery been made a few years earlier, it would have been dismissed as preposterous. However, now that science had accepted Rutherford's nuclear atom (see 1911), it seemed possible that under some conditions atoms might break down and the nuclei approach each other more closely than in ordinary matter. In the case of broken-atom degenerate matter, densities might easily be a million times that of ordinary matter. Sirius's companion (now more commonly known as Sirius B, while Sirius itself is sometimes called Sirius A), being both tiny and white-hot, was called a white dwarf. It was the first of this class to be discovered, but white dwarfs were eventually found to be quite common, though only those relatively close to us can be seen because of their low total luminosity.		
jupiter-ix	1914	Jupiter IX	Jupiter VIII and IX are tiny moons of Jupiter which circle their host planet at an average distance of about 15 million miles, greater than any other known satellite in the Solar System. It takes over two years to complete one orbit.	Seth Barnes Nicholson	United States	jupiters-outer-satellites	Space	In 1908 the French astronomer Philibert Jacques Melotte discovered Jupiter VIII, which was still farther from Jupiter than VII and VI were. Jupiter VIII circled Jupiter at an average distance of 14,600,000 miles. Then in 1914 the American astronomer Seth Barnes Nicholson (1891–1963) discovered Jupiter IX. Its average distance from Jupiter is 14,700,000 miles and it circles Jupiter in two years and one month. No other known satellite anywhere in the Solar System circles its primary at a greater distance.		
acetylcholine	1914	Acetylcholine	Acetylcholine is a compound isolated from the ergot fungus, which affects animal tissues similar to certain nerves through a disease called ergotism which occasionally broke out in devastating epidemics. Its full significance was not understood until years later.	Henry Hallett Dale	England	medicinal-plants	Science: Biology	A fungus called ergot produces a variety of alkaloids with powerful effects on animal tissues. The eating of fungus-ridden grain can produce a disease called ergotism, and in the centuries before the cause was understood, there were terrible epidemics of ergotism. Among those who worked on ergot was a British biologist, Henry Hallett Dale (1875–1968). In 1914 he isolated from it a compound called acetylcholine, which seemed to produce effects on organs similar to those produced by certain nerves. The significance of this was not fully understood for several more years.		
earths-mantle-and-core	1914	Earth's mantle and core	Earth's core and mantle were identified as distinct layers based on earthquake wave behavior, suggesting the core is liquid and mainly nickel-iron in a 1-9 ratio. The mantle is composed of rocky material. The two layers are separated by the Gutenberg discontinuity.	Beno Gutenberg	USA	mohorovicic-discontinuity	Science: Geology	The waves set up by earthquakes apparently did not reach all parts of the Earth’s surface even when they were strong enough to be detected everywhere. There was a shadow zone within which no waves were detectable. The German-born American geologist Beno Gutenberg (1889–1960), studying this phenomenon, suggested in 1914 that there was a core at the center of the Earth, about 2100 miles in radius, that was markedly different in density and chemical composition from the material outside that radius. Earthquake waves entering the core would be refracted in such a way as to be sent beyond the shadow zone. Based on the fact that transverse waves did not enter the core at all, Gutenberg suggested that the core was liquid. Thus the Earth is divided into two parts, an inner core, which (from its high density, and the fact that iron meteorites are common) seems likely to consist of liquid nickel-iron in a 1-to-9 ratio, and an outer mantle made up of rocky material. These two are in about the proportion of yolk to white in an egg, and the outermost crust is about the proportion of the eggshell. The sharp dividing line between the mantle and the core is called the Gutenberg discontinuity.		
behaviorism	1914	Behaviorism	Behaviorism was the thesis that human behavior is explainable in terms of conditioned responses and experience. It emerged as an alternative to Freud's theories and minimized the role of heredity and viewed animals, including humans, as machines reacting to nerve-path conditioning.	John Broadus Watson	United States	conditioned-response, dreams	Science: Psychology	The American psychologist John Broadus Watson (1878-1958) developed the thesis that human behavior was explainable in terms of conditioned responses, such as those Pavlov had demonstrated. Watson relegated even heredity to a minor role. Animals, including the human being, he viewed as intensely complicated machines, which reacted according to their nerve-path wiring, those nerve paths being altered, or conditioned, by experience. This view of Watson's was called behaviorism.

pellagra	1915	Pellagra	Pellagra, a disease prevalent in the American South post-Civil War, was identified as non-contagious and related to diet deficiencies in milk, meat, or eggs by Joseph Goldberger through experiments on prisoners. While contagious transmission was ruled out, the specific dietary deficiency was still undetermined but termed the pellagra-preventive factor.	Joseph Goldberger	United States	dietary-deficiency-diseases	Science: Medicine	Pellagra was a disease that was endemic in the American South after the Civil War. It didn't seem contagious, and Funk had speculated that it might be a vitamin-deficiency disease (see 1896). The Austrian-born American physician Joseph Goldberger (1874-1929) noted that it struck wherever the diet was monotonous and limited and did not include much in the way of milk, meat, or eggs. In 1915 he conducted a dramatic experiment on prisoners in a Mississippi jail. Volunteers (who were promised pardons in return) were placed on a limited diet lacking meat or milk. After six months, they developed pellagra, which was relieved by adding milk and meat to their diet. During this time Goldberger's study group went to great lengths to try to contract pellagra by contact with the patients, their clothing, and their excretions. They failed. Pellagra was definitely not contagious. Goldberger spoke of a P-P (pellagra-preventive) factor in the diet, but its chemical nature was as yet unknown.		
thyroxine	1915	Thyroxine	The Thyroxine hormone was isolated from thyroglobulin. This iodine-containing amino acid is responsible for the overall rate of metabolism in the body, so that the more active the thyroid gland, the faster the human metabolic rate.	Edward Calvin Kendall	United States	hormones	Science: Medicine	About a quarter of a century earlier, the thyroid gland in the throat had been shown to be responsible for the overall rate of metabolism of the body, so that the human engine raced, so to speak, when the thyroid was overactive and slowed to a crawl when it was underactive. Once Starling had advanced the hormone concept (see 1902 and 1905), it was clear that the thyroid must do its work by way of a hormone. It was known that the thyroid contained a characteristic protein called thyroglobulin, which was unique in possessing iodine, an element not till then known to be essential to life. The American biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall (1886-1972) studied thyroglobulin looking for some simple component that would do the work of the thyroid gland in trace quantities and that would therefore qualify as the hormone involved. In 1915 he isolated what he called thyroxine. In the course of subsequent years, it turned out to be an iodine-containing amino acid related to the tyrosine found in proteins. It was the hormone.		
bacteriophages	1915	Bacteriophages	Bacteriophages, viruses that infect and kill bacteria, were discovered independently by two scientists. This discovery highlighted a significant aspect of microbial life and pathogenic processes.	Frederick William Twort	England	bacteriology	Science: Biology	No type of cell is immune to the ravages of the subcellular parasites called viruses. Even the smallest cells, those of bacteria, can be victimized. The British bacteriologist Frederick William Twort (1877-1950) discovered, in 1915, a type of virus that infested and killed bacteria. The discovery was made again, independently, some time afterward by a Canadian-born bacteriologist, Felix d'Hérelle (1873-1949). D'Hérelle named the viruses bacteriophages (Greek for 'bacteria-eaters').		
elliptical-electron-orbits	1915	Elliptical electron orbits	The Bohr-Sommerfeld atom model suggests that electron orbits can be elliptical, not just circular. This refinement explained more details in spectral lines and integrated relativity and quantum theory.	Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld	Germany	elliptical-orbits, quantized-atom, special-relativity	Science: Physics	The German physicist Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld (1868-1951) felt the answer lay in the fact that electron orbits were more complicated than Bohr had suggested. Bohr had made use of perfectly circular orbits, but the orbits (like planetary orbits) might also be elliptical. Sommerfeld used Einstein's theory of relativity to calculate the elliptical orbits and quantum theory to show that only certain kinds of ellipses were possible. The combination of circular and elliptical orbits explained some of the details of the spectra that Bohr's original treatment had left unexplained. For this reason, people sometimes speak of the Bohr-Sommerfeld atom. It made use of the two great physical theories of the twentieth century, relativity and quanta.		
hydrogen-helium-conversion	1915	Hydrogen-Helium conversion	The concept of hydrogen to helium conversion hypothesizes that converting four hydrogen nuclei into one helium nucleus releases significant energy. The mass deficit in helium compared to hydrogen nuclei accounts for this energy release.	William Draper Harkins	United States	radioactive-energy	Science: Chemistry	Pierre Curie had shown that radioactivity implied the existence of enormous amounts of energy somewhere deep in the atom (see 1901). Physicists had not yet straightened out the matter in detail, but in 1915 the American chemist William Draper Harkins (1875-1951) noted that the helium nucleus was not quite four times as massive as the hydrogen nucleus. Therefore, if four hydrogen nuclei could somehow be converted to a helium nucleus, the excess mass not needed for the helium nucleus would represent a great quantity of energy that could be released. He was perfectly correct, but it was to be forty years before scientists learned how to bring about that conversion.		
general-relativity	1916	General relativity	General relativity extended the principles of special relativity to any velocity, accounting for space curvature in the presence of mass and introducing cosmology. It reconciled existing gravitational phenomena without hypothetical planets and predicted new effects like light redshift and deflection by gravity.	Albert Einstein	Germany	special-relativity, space-time	Science: Physics	Eleven years before, Einstein had advanced his special theory of relativity, in which he showed that the laws of physics remained unchanged in systems moving at constant velocity relative to each other (see 1905). In 1916 he extended this to systems moving relative to each other at any velocity, however changing. This was his general theory of relativity, often shortened to general relativity. To make this possible, he assumed that inertial mass (mass derived from measurements of acceleration) and gravitational mass (mass derived from measurements of gravitational intensity) were identical. He also assumed that space was curved in the presence of mass, and that gravitation was not a force but merely the result of moving objects following the shortest possible path in curved space. He advanced a set of equations to cover all this, equations that allowed grand conclusions to be drawn about the universe as a whole, so that he founded the science of cosmology. Einstein pointed out that Newton’s laws of gravitation produced results quite close to those of general relativity but that there were three kinds of differences that might be measured in order to decide which was a closer approach to reality. First, Einstein’s theory allowed for a shift in the position of the perihelion of a planetary orbit slightly beyond that which would be expected in a Newtonian Universe. This advance of the perihelion had been discovered by Leverrier in the case of Mercury (see 1846, Vulcan) seventy years earlier. General relativity explained it without having to call upon an intra-Mercurian planet, which had never been found. The fact that this effect was already known rather diminished its importance, however. Second, Einstein showed that light moving upward against a strong gravitational field should show a red shift. This involved something that had not been expected earlier, but even the Sun’s gravitational field wasn’t intense enough to make the measurement practical. Nothing much could be done with the prediction, therefore. Third, and most dramatic, Einstein showed that light would be deflected by a gravitational field substantially more than would be expected in a Newtonian Universe, and the difference could be measured. To do so, however, it would be necessary to locate stars in the neighborhood of the Sun during a total eclipse. Their light would have reached Earth		
black-holes	1916	Black holes	Schwarzschild calculated that sufficiently massive and dense stars have a point beyond which not even light can escape, known as the Schwarzschild radius. This concept eventually led to the term 'black hole'.	Karl Schwarzschild	Germany	general-relativity, white-dwarfs	Space	After Einstein's equations for general relativity were published, the first to work out solutions for them was a German astronomer, Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916). He also calculated the gravitational phenomena in the neighborhood of a star with all its mass concentrated to a point. In order for an object to move infinitely far from a body as the result of a single initial impulse, that initial impulse must produce a speed that will carry the object away so rapidly that its speed will not decline as quickly as does the gravitational pull (which declines with the square of the increasing distance). In that case, the gravitational pull will never be intense enough to bring the object to a complete halt. This escape velocity equals 7 miles per second for Earth but only 1.5 miles per second for the Moon. In general, the escape velocity from an object's surface increases with the mass of the attracting object and also with its density. Over a century earlier, Laplace (see 1783) had pointed out that if an object was sufficiently massive and dense, even light wouldn't have sufficient velocity to escape. Schwarzschild studied the case of a star with a mass compressed more and more strongly till the star's volume sank to zero, so that the gravitational pull at its surface got higher and higher without limit. Schwarzschild calculated the distance from such a point-mass at which light would barely have the speed to escape. This is the Schwarzschild radius. Once anything approached closer to the star than the Schwarzschild radius, it could never escape again. Not even light could. Since nothing could escape, not even light, such a star would behave like a bottomless hole in space, so to speak. It would be a black hole, a name given to it half a century later.		
electrons-and-chemical-bonds	1916	Electrons and chemical bonds	Lewis suggested that chemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, establishing molecular bonds. These electrons can appear in different configurations: a full outer orbital means an unreactive element (e.g. noble gas), but an outer orbital missing one electron (e.g. chlorine) is very reactive.	Gilbert Newton Lewis	United States	atomic-number, characteristic-x-rays, valence-theory	Science: Chemistry	Once Moseley had advanced his notion of atomic numbers (see 1914), it was understood that the neutral atom contained as many electrons in its outskirts as the value of the atomic number. A hydrogen atom had one planetary electron, a uranium atom had ninety-two, and the other elements had numbers in between. What's more, study of the characteristic X rays of elements, which had been initiated by Barkla (see 1906), gave rise to the notion that the electrons existed in successive shells. Clearly, it was the electrons in the outermost shell that were most exposed and were therefore most capable of being removed, or of being shifted from one atom to another. The German chemist Richard Wilhelm Heinrich Abegg (1869-1910) had already suggested in 1904, even before the details of electron shells had been worked out, that chemical reactions were the result of electrons being transferred from one atom to another. An American chemist, Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875-1946), went into the matter in greater detail.		
superheterodyne-receiver	1917	Superheterodyne receiver	Up to now, operating a radio required a specialized radio engineer but this changed when Armstrong devised a way to lower the frequency of transmitted radiowaves and amplifying them. This innovation made radios easier to use, paving the way for widespread home use and mass communication.	Edwin Howard Armstrong	United States	radio-waves-and-sound	Design			
expanding-universe-theory	1917	Expanding universe theory	Einstein initially thought the universe was static and added a constant to his equations to support this. This new theory suggested that the equations actually implied the universe was expanding, a concept that later gained significant importance.	Willem de Sitter	Netherlands	general-relativity	Space	It had always been assumed by the Greeks that the Universe was changeless, and even the astronomers of the modern period, while aware that stars varied and moved and came into being and dimmed to death, felt that such changes canceled each other out and left the Universe as a whole unchanged.Einstein, in formulating his general relativity equations, understood that if he was to have a static Universe, something would have to be added to the equations. He therefore added an arbitrary constant designed to make the equations come out right, so to speak. He later said this was the greatest scientific mistake of his life. A Dutch astronomer, Willem de Sitter (1872—1934), however, was content to travel wherever Einstein’s equations took him. He pointed out, in 1917, that if the equations were solved as they stood, the implication was that the Universe was expanding. Such a picture of an expanding universe seemed grotesque, for at the time, nothing about the Universe seemed to give a hint of this expansion, but de Sitter’s suggestion took on a great deal of importance in the next decade.		
microcrystalline-diffraction	1917	Microcrystalline diffraction	The Braggs established a method to determine crystal structures using X-ray diffraction. This advance showed that useful results could also be obtained by diffracting powdered solids.	Peter Joseph William Debye	United States	x-ray-diffraction	Science: Physics	The Braggs had shown how crystal structure could be worked out by X-ray diffraction (see 1914). Intact and reasonably large crystals are hard to come by,		
100-inch-telescope	1917	100-inch telescope	In no science is the advance of instrumentation as important and as dramatic as in astronomy. In 1917 a new reflecting telescope was put into action on Mount Wilson, near Pasadena, California. Its mirror was 100 inches across, which made it the largest telescope in the world at that time, and it was to remain the largest for three decades.

protactinium	1917	Protactinium	By this point most new "elements" turned out to be isotopes of existing ones, but protactinium was an exception, highly radioactive and spontaneously disintegrates into actinium. This element filled one of the seven gaps in the periodic table identified by Moseley.	Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner	Germany, Austria	isotopes, actinium, atomic-number	Science: Chemistry	Few of the new substances being detected as radioactive breakdown products of uranium and thorium were truly new elements. Once Soddy's isotope concept had been advanced (see 1913), most of the new substances were recognized as isotopes of elements that were already known. In 1917, however, the German physical chemist Otto Hahn (1879–1968) and a co-worker, Austrian physicist Lise Meitner (1878–1968), discovered a truly new element that disintegrated into actinium (see 1899). They therefore named the new element protactinium (meaning 'before actinium'). It turned out to be element number 91, one of the seven missing elements at the time Moseley had advanced his atomic number concept (see 1914). That left only six elements to go.		
sonar	1917	Sonar	Paul Langevin developed a system of echolocation called sonar that uses ultrasonic sound vibrations to detect underwater objects, and determine their distance of an object without having visual line-of-sight. Sonar became a significant tool in oceanography and underwater detection.	Paul Langevin	France	piezoelectricity	Science: Physics	Pierre Curie, in discovering piezoelectricity (see 1880), had shown how to produce ultrasonic sound vibrations. These were put to use by the French physicist Paul Langevin (1872–1946). Waves are more easily reflected the shorter their length. Ordinary sound waves are long enough to bend around ordinary obstacles and are not efficiently reflected. The much shorter sound waves of ultrasonic vibration can easily be reflected by relatively small objects. The direction from which the reflection is received indicates the direction of the object, and the time it takes between emission and reflection (knowing the speed of sound) gives the distance, or range, of the object. Since light cannot penetrate large thicknesses of water and ultrasonic vibrations can, the latter can be used to detect underwater objects such as submarines when light is impotent. Since World War I was raging and German submarines were a deadly danger to the Allies, it is not surprising that Langevin worked with that purpose in mind. Langevin's system of echolocation was called sonar, an acronym (combination of initial letters) of sound navigation and ranging. While Langevin had the technique worked out in 1917, it could not be put into effective use before the end of the war. Sonar is now used not only for the detection of underwater objects such as submarines and schools of fish, but also to study the conformation of the ocean floor. Sonar utterly revolutionized oceanography.		
center-of-the-galaxy	1918	Center of the galaxy	A century ago, astronomers observed that almost all star clusters were found in one hemisphere of the sky. Using the Cepheid yardstick and the latest telescope, a three-dimensional model of the Milky Way's globular clusters was created, revealing their spherical arrangement around Sagittarius. We now know that we are about 30,000 ly from the center of the galaxy, and that it is 100,000 ly across.	Harlow Shapley	United States	100-inch-telescope, magellanic-cloud-distances, galaxy-observed, heliocentric-practice	Space	By 1918 he was able to make a three-dimensional model of the globular clusters and could see that they themselves formed a loose sphere around a point in Sagittarius far distant from the Solar System.		
spectral-classes	1918	Spectral classes	A classification system for star spectra was developed, arranging stars by surface temperature using a system of letters: The spectral classes of the main sequence, in order of decreasing temperature, turned out to be O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, and each class is divided into ten numbers. Sun is a G2 star, Sirius is A1, Rigel is B5, Arcturus is K2, Betelgeuse is M2, etc.	Annie Jump Cannon	United States	main-sequence	Space	She worked up a classification that is still used today. She used a system of letters, planning that there would be a smooth transition from A to B to C and so on. However, as the stars were arranged in order of decreasing surface temperature, the letters fell out of order, and some had to be omitted.		
radioactive-tracers	1918	Radioactive lead tracing	Inspired by using benzene rings as a tracer in fat metabolism, Hevesy utilized a radioactive isotope of lead to measure the concentration of lead compounds, which had identical chemical properties to ordinary lead. This technique proved to be highly effective for tracing lead in various substances and was later utilized in biochemical studies.	George de Hevesy	Hungary	organic-tracers	Science: Chemistry	In 1918 Hevesy decided to make use of a radioactive isotope of lead, formed by uranium breakdown. This radiolead was identical in chemical properties to ordinary stable lead. Suppose, then, he were to add a small quantity of radiolead to lead and use the mixture to produce certain lead compounds. These lead compounds are only slightly soluble in water, so that one could not measure the concentration of the dissolved stable lead with anything approaching accuracy. If, however, a lead compound with radiolead added is stirred in water so that a tiny fraction of the molecules dissolve, that same tiny fraction of the molecules containing radio-lead also dissolves. The amount of radio-lead in solution can then be easily and accurately determined, and the percentage of radiolead compound dissolved will be the same as that of the ordinary lead compound. In later years, Hevesy followed the manner in which plants absorbed and distributed water by spiking it with a tiny quantity of radiolead compound that he could follow accurately. As long as radioactive tracing was confined to lead, it could only play a minor role, of course. Nevertheless, Hevesy had pointed out the potential of the technique, and the time was to come when it was to be a superb and essential tool for biochemists and others.		
embryo-organizer	1918	Embryo organizer	Spemann's work demonstrated that individual cells in an embryo affect each other's development, and that cells can remain plastic late into embryogenesis. His experiments with dividing embryos provided insights into developmental biology, leading to the discovery of 'organizers' in embryos and earning him a Nobel Prize in 1935.	Hans Spemann	Germany	meiosis, notochord	Science: Biology	The German zoologist Hans Spemann (1869-1941) was interested in the development of embryos. Thirty years later, it had been shown that if the fertilized ovum of a test animal was divided in two, and if one of the resulting cells was killed with a hot needle, then the remaining cell would evolve into a longitudinal half of an embryo. The act of dividing in two had established the plane of bilateral symmetry. If, however, a fertilized ovum divided in two and the two resulting cells were separated and each allowed to develop, each would form a complete (though smaller than normal) embryo. (It is this which results in the birth of identical twins among human beings, for instance.) To Spemann, the difference between a cell that developed from a divided fertilized ovum and one that developed while attached to a dead partner indicated that the individual cells of an embryo affected each other. In a series of experiments, Spemann showed that even after an embryo had begun to show definite signs of differentiation, it could still be divided in half, with each half producing a whole embryo. This showed that cells remained plastic until quite late in the game. Spemann found that an embryo develops according to the nature of neighboring areas. An eyeball develops originally out of brain material and is joined by a lens that develops out of nearby skin. If the eyeball is placed near a distant section of the skin, one that would never in the course of nature develop a lens, it nevertheless begins to develop one. There were apparently organizers in the embryo that brought about certain developments nearby. For his work, Spemann was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1935.		
mass-spectrometer	1919	Mass spectrometer	Aston improved on Thomson's apparatus so that it was capable of delicately separating ions by their mass for photographic detection. It showed that elements could have multiple stable isotopes, each with the same charge but differing mass numbers, for example Chlorine 35 and 37.	Francis William Aston	England	neon-varieties, isotopes	Science: Chemistry	Soddy had advanced the isotope concept (see 1913), but it had at first seemed to apply only to radioactive elements and their breakdown products. Could perfectly stable elements also exist in the form of different isotopes? Was that the significance of Thomson's findings with respect to neon? The British chemist Francis William Aston (1877-1945) improved on Thomson's apparatus and		
nuclear-reaction	1919	Nuclear reaction	A nuclear reaction was engineered, converting nitrogen (nucleus charge +7) into oxygen (nucleus charge +8) by bombarding it with alpha particles. Ordinary chemical reactions involve the transfer or sharing of electrons, as Lewis had pointed out. Now Rutherford had produced reactions that involved the transfer of particles inside the nucleus.	Ernest Rutherford	England	electrons-and-chemical-bonds, alpha-particles	Science: Physics	Rutherford, in his work with alpha-particle bombardments of matter (see 1906), had made gases his target. For instance, when he bombarded hydrogen, he got bright scintillations on a zinc sulfide screen (which gave off a flash of light whenever struck by an energetic subatomic particle). The alpha particles themselves produced scintillations, but the new scintillations, which appeared when hydrogen was present, were particularly bright. Rutherford decided (correctly) that the alpha particles occasionally struck a hydrogen nucleus (consisting of a single proton) and hurled it forward. It was these speeding protons, he felt, that produced the bright scintillations. In 1919, when nitrogen was introduced into the cylinder, occasional bright scintillations like those of protons were produced. Rutherford knew that the nitrogen nucleus had a charge of +7, so that it had to contain at least seven protons. He felt that the alpha particle must knock one of these protons out of the nitrogen nucleus every once in a while. The number of alpha-particle scintillations produced under these circumstances gradually decreased. Rutherford reasoned that some of the particles must be absorbed by the nitrogen nuclei. If a nitrogen nucleus absorbed an alpha particle with its charge of +2 and lost a proton with its charge of +1, the net change would leave the nitrogen nucleus with a total charge of +8. This is the characteristic charge of an oxygen nucleus. In short, what Rutherford had done was to combine a helium nucleus (an alpha particle) and a nitrogen nucleus to form a hydrogen nucleus (a proton) and an oxygen nucleus. He had converted one type of atom into another by sub-atomic bombardment. Ordinary chemical reactions involve the transfer or sharing of electrons, as Lewis had pointed out (see 1916). Now Rutherford had produced reactions that involved the transfer of particles inside the nucleus. In other words, he had brought about the first humanly engineered nuclear reaction.		
gravitational-deflection-of-light	1919	Gravitational deflection of light	Einstein's theory of general relativity predicted that light rays would bend near a massive object like the Sun. This was confirmed during a solar eclipse studied from Brazil and West Africa simultaneously, studying positions of bright stars near the sun. It was found that stellar positions varied depending on the proximity of the sun, confirming Einstein's theory.	Albert Einstein	England	general-relativity	Science: Physics	Einstein had advanced the theory of general relativity, which among other things predicted that light rays would bend slightly and follow a gently curved path when in a gravitational field (see 1916). The one way of testing that would be to study the stars in the immediate neighborhood of the Sun during a total eclipse, but astronomers had to wait for the end of World War I to make an eclipse expedition feasible. On May 29, 1919, a solar eclipse was scheduled to take place at just the time when more bright stars would be in the vicinity of the eclipsed Sun than would be there at any other time of the year. The Royal Astronomical Society of London, under the leadership of Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882-1944), who was a great enthusiast of Einstein's theories, made ready two expeditions, one to northern Brazil and one to Principe Island in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of West Africa. The positions of the bright stars near the Sun were measured relative to each other at the time of the eclipse. If light was bent in its passage near the Sun, those stars would all seem to shift away from the Sun and would appear to be slightly farther apart from each other than they would six months earlier or six months later when they rode high in the midnight sky. The positions of the stars proved to be in line with what Einstein had predicted, and this was considered a grand verification of general relativity. However, the measurements were borderline and a trifle uncertain, and none of the tests of general relativity were entirely conclusive for an additional forty years, so that a number of other types of cosmological theories were advanced to compete with that of Einstein. (On the other hand, special relativity was confirmed over and over, and there has been no reasonable doubt concerning it for three-fourths of a century.)		
bee-communication	1919	Bee communication	Karl von Frisch conditioned bees to gather nectar and determined that they can see ultraviolet light. He also discovered that bees communicate the location of food sources through a 'dance' that conveys direction and distance information.	Karl von Frisch	Germany	conditioned-response	Science: Biology	Pavlov's conditioned responses (see 1907) could be used to elicit answers from animals about what they sensed. The Austrian-born German zoologist Karl von Frisch (1886-1982), for instance, conditioned bees to go to certain locations to pick up nectar, making certain that the location was of a certain color. They would then fly to other places of the same color, since they had been conditioned to react to that color as they would to a food source. Frisch then changed the color to see what would happen to the conditioning. Thus, if he conditioned the bees to black and then substituted red, they flew to it anyway, indicating that they could not see red--red was black to them. However, if they were conditioned to black and that was changed to ultraviolet (which would still look black to human eyes), the bees no longer flew to it. They could see ultraviolet. By 1919 Frisch had also interpreted the manner in which the bee communicated its findings to its colleagues of the hive. Having obtained honey from a new source, the returning bee would 'dance,' moving round and round or side to side. The number of the evolutions and their speed gave the necessary information about the location of the new source. Frisch also showed that bees could orient themselves in flight by the direction of the sun.		
stellar-diameter	1920	Stellar diameter	Michelson used a 20-foot interferometer and a 100-inch telescope to measure the diameter of the star Betelgeuse. The diameter was calculated to be about 260 million miles, making it 300 times that of the Sun.	Albert Abraham Michelson	United States	100-inch-telescope, interferometer	Space	Throughout history, stars had been studied only as points of light, and all information about them had to be obtained in ways that required only points. In 1920, however, Michelson, who had first used his interferometer to compare the speed of light in different directions (see 1881), used it for another purpose. He built a 20-foot interferometer and attached it to the new 100-inch telescope (see 1917). With it, he could measure light emerging from either side of the star Betelgeuse. (Betelgeuse is a relatively near red giant, so that its diameter was likely to prove more measurable than that of smaller or more distant stars.) The two rays from the sides of Betelgeuse made a very tiny angle, but from the interference fringes they produced, Michelson could measure the angle, and from that angle, knowing the distance of Betelgeuse, he could calculate its diameter. He worked it out to be about 260 million miles, or 300 times the width of our Sun. It was news that made the first page of the New York Times.		
novas-in-andromeda	1920	Novas in andromeda	The Andromeda nebula was debated among astronomers, with some believing it was part of our Galaxy and others positing it as a separate collection of stars. Curtis observed unusually bright stars called novas which suggested that the nebula contained a large number of very faint stars, and that it was an independent galaxy, but Shapley thought otherwise. The matter remained unresolved.	Heber Doust Curtis	United States	center-of-the-galaxy	Space	The Andromeda nebula was a matter of dispute among astronomers in the early decades of the twentieth century. There were some who thought it was a cloud of dust and gas that was part of our own Galaxy (and that the same was true of other nebulas that resembled it). Others pointed out that the spectrum of the Andromeda and other such nebulas was that of starlight and not at all like that of the Orion nebula, which was clearly a cloud of dust and gas. The Andromeda nebula and others like it might therefore be vast assemblages of stars that were independent galaxies but so far away from us that there was little hope of seeing their stars individually. The leading exponent of a nearby Andromeda nebula was Shapely, who had worked out the shape and size of the Galaxy and determined the position of the Solar System within it (see 1918). The leading exponent of a far-off Andromeda nebula was the American Astronomer Heber Doust Curtis. Curtis reasoned that, although the Andromeda nebula might be too far away for ordinary stars in it to be made out, unusually bright stars such as novas ought to be visible. He therefore observed the nebula carefully and did see numerous very faint.		
hidalgo	1920	Hidalgo	An asteroid named Hidalgo with an unusual orbit was discovered, extending far beyond the typical asteroid belt. Its discovery adds to the understanding of the diverse trajectories of asteroids in our solar system.	Walter Baade	Germany	trojan-asteroids	Space	Asteroids with atypical orbits continued to be discovered. In 1920 the German astronomer Walter Baade (1893–1960) detected an asteroid that he named Hidalgo. At its perihelion, it is within the asteroid belt, but its orbit balloons outward, so that at aphelion it is as far from the Sun as Saturn is.		
dendrochronology	1920	Dendrochronology	The study of tree rings, or dendrochronology, was developed as a practical method to date wood and ancient objects. This technique allows for precise dating of historical items and is particularly useful in archaeology.	Andrew Ellicott Douglass	United States		Science: Biology	Ancient wood is well preserved in Arizona’s dry climate, and the American astronomer Andrew Ellicott Douglass (1867–1962) grew interested in it. The wooden trunk of a tree contains rings that mark annual growth, wide ones in good years, narrow ones in bad years. Since all trees in a region share the same good years and bad years, all of them have similar tree-ring patterns. These patterns are characteristic and do not ever quite repeat themselves over time. Therefore, if a piece of old wood is placed overlapping the tree-ring pattern of a freshly produced tree stump, you can determine the year in which the old wood was cut by counting rings of the new wood back to where the overlap begins. You can then follow its pattern back farther than you could that of the fresh wood, still older pieces of wood can be fitted on, and so on. By 1920, when Douglass convinced himself that such dendrochronology (Greek for “time-telling by trees”) was a practical way of determining age where wood was concerned, he had traced his tree-ring calendar back for about five thousand years. The technique was particularly useful in dating objects of Native American prehistory.		
climatic-cycles	1920	Climatic cycles	Long-term weather patterns and periodic ice ages may be influenced by slow oscillations in Earth's orbit and axis tilt. These astronomical factors create a roughly 40,000-year cycle of climatic changes.	Milutin Milankovitch	Serbia	varves	Science: Geology	Weather is so erratic that even the most modern devices have trouble predicting it long in advance. Nevertheless, very general cycles of weather may exist, and these may explain the periodic ice ages that have occurred in the last million years of Earth’s history. In 1920 the Yugoslavian physicist Milutin Milankovitch (1879–1958) suggested that astronomic factors played a part. Slow oscillations in the eccentricity of Earth’s orbit and in the tilting of the Earth’s axis, together with the precession of that axis, seemed to suggest a 40,000-year cycle, which could be divided into a Great Spring, Great Summer, Great Autumn, and Great Winter.		
anemia	1920	Anemia cure	A method to cure a severe form of anemia was discovered by inducing anemia in dogs and experimenting with various diets. The discovery identified iron as the key element and liver as a powerful foodstuff for correcting anemia.	George Hoyt Whipple	United States	dietary-deficiency-diseases, hemoglobin	Science: Medicine	The American pathologist George Hoyt Whipple induced an artificial anemia in dogs by bleeding them, then followed the manner in which new red blood corpuscles were formed. He kept the dogs on various kinds of diets to see what effect would be produced on corpuscle formation and found that, of the various foodstuffs he tried, liver was the most potent in correcting such anemia. This eventually led the way to the cure for a kind of anemia much more dangerous than simple iron-deficiency anemia.		
air-masses	1920	Air masses	A father and son team of researchers discovered that the atmosphere consists of large air masses with temperature differences and defined the boundaries as fronts. This finding advanced weather prediction techniques.	Vilhelm Friman Koren Bjerknes and Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes	Norway	stratosphere	Science: Meteorology	A father-and-son team of meteorologists, Vilhelm Friman Koren Bjerknes and Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes, had set up weather-observing stations all over Norway during World War I. By 1920 they had shown that the atmosphere is made up of large air masses and that there is a sharp differentiation in temperature between warm tropical air masses and cold polar air masses. The sharp boundaries between them they called fronts, from an analogy to the battle lines that had so preoccupied Europe in recent years. This simplified the technique of weather prediction.		
insulin	1921	Insulin	Insulin was discovered to control carbohydrate metabolism and alleviate symptoms of diabetes. Researchers isolated it from degenerated pancreas tissue, finding that it was produced inside the previously identified Islets of Langerhans, thus the name insulin, from the Latin word for island.	Frederick Grant Banting	Canada	hormones, islets-of-langerhans	Science: Biology	By this time it seemed clear that the serious disease of diabetes mellitus had something to do with the pancreas; removal of the pancreas from experimental animals invariably produced a diabeteslike condition. Once the hormone concept had been propounded by Starling (see 1902 and 1905), it was easily assumed that some hormone produced by the pancreas exerted control over carbohydrate metabolism. In the absence of the hormone, carbohydrate metabolism went out of control, with the result that glucose built up in the blood and spilled out in the urine. A variety of unpleasant symptoms made themselves manifest—with death as the end. To be sure, it was well established that the chief function of the pancreas was to produce protein-digesting enzymes, but there were portions of the pancreas that seemed different from the rest. These portions, scattered through the pancreatic background, were the islets of Langerhans (see 1869). Some suspected that the islets produced the necessary hormone, and there were suggestions that the hormone be called insulin, from the Latin word for 'island.' No one had managed to isolate the hormone from pancreatic tissue, however. This was not surprising, since if insulin were protein in nature (as indeed it turned out to be), the digestive enzymes in the pancreas would digest and destroy it before it could be isolated. The Canadian physician Frederick Grant Banting (1891–1941) had read that if the pancreatic duct was tied off in a living animal, the pancreatic tissue degenerated. The islets of Langerhans, however, whose hormone product would not then be discharged through the duct but secreted directly into the bloodstream, were not affected. Then why not attempt to isolate insulin from a degenerated pancreas, in which no digestive enzymes would exist to spoil the extraction? In 1921 Banting managed to obtain space at the University of Toronto and to get the services of an assistant, the American-born Canadian physiologist Charles Herbert Best (1899–1978). Together Banting and Best tied off the pancreatic ducts in a number of dogs and waited seven weeks for the pancreas to degenerate. They then extracted a solution that quickly stopped the symptoms of diabetes. They had insulin. As a result, Banting was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1923.		
vagusstoffe	1921	Vagusstoffe	Working with the vagus nerve attached to a frog's heart, Loewi showed that chemical substances are released when nerves are stimulated, particularly during synaptic transmission. It was later discovered that this "vagus material" was acetylcholine.	Otto Loewi	United States	acetylcholine, neuron-theory	Science: Biology	It was well known by this time that the nerve impulse was electrical in nature. The German-born American pharmacologist Otto Loewi (1873–1961) felt that chemicals were involved, too, especially where the nerve impulse had to jump the tiny gap (or synapse) from one nerve cell to another. In 1921, working with the nerves attached to a frog's heart, particularly the vagus nerve, he showed that chemical substances were indeed set free when the nerve was stimulated. The idea for testing to		
rickets	1921	Rickets	By now rickets could be linked to a deficiency in a fat-soluble vitamin, but it was distinct from vitamin A, B, and C. This discovery established that the vitamin for preventing rickets was called Vitamin D, which was found in cod-liver oil and butter. Other researchers suspected that sunshine also had a rickets-inhibiting effect.	Edward Mellanby	England	vitamins-a-and-b	Science: Biology	By now McCollum had distinguished between fat-soluble vitamin A and water-soluble vitamin B (see 1913). Vitamin C, the anti-scurvy factor, was also water-soluble but had no effect on beriberi and was therefore a substance different from vitamin B.		
glutathione	1921	Glutathione	The tripeptide (three amino acids) glutathione was isolated. This compound can easily switch between reduced and oxidized states and its properties make it important in tissue chemistry as it helps protect delicate compounds and facilitates the transfer of atomic groupings.	Frederick Gowland Hopkins	England	tryptophan	Science: Chemistry	In 1921 Hopkins (see 1900, Tryptophan) isolated glutathione from tissues. It is a combination of three amino acids (a tripeptide) and switches easily between a reduced and oxidized state. That is, it can easily be made either to give up a pair of hydrogen atoms or to take them up again. Hopkins demonstrated this ability on the part of glutathione and argued for its importance in tissue chemistry. First, such compounds can act as protectors for delicate compounds. By giving up their hydrogen atoms readily, they make it unnecessary for other compounds to give up theirs when that loss might do some damage harder to repair. Also, by bouncing back and forth between the two states, glutathione (and other such compounds) can bring about the easy transfer of atomic groupings from one substance to another.		
magnetrons	1921	Magnetrons	The magnetron was a diode that produced high-intensity short radio waves. This technology was later instrumental in the development of radar.	Albert Wallace Hull	United States	electronic-rectifier, radio	Science: Physics	By this time, many different varieties of radio tubes were being developed. In 1921 the American physicist Albert Wallace Hull (1880-1966) developed a diode (see 1904) that could produce bursts of short radio waves (microwaves) of high intensity. He called it a magnetron, because an external magnet was used to apply a magnetic field to the electrodes inside the tube. In the next decade, tubes of this sort played a key role in the development of radar.		
tetraethyl-lead	1921	Tetraethyl lead	Excessively rapid burning of gasoline in the engine caused explosions inside the engine which reduced efficiency, wore down the mechanisms, and were loud. Tetraethyl lead was added to gasoline to make "leaded gasoline" to mitigate this problem, but introduced lead accumulation in the cylinder. A volatile bromine compound was added to mitigate that, leading to excessive air pollution.	Thomas Midgley, Jr.	United States	coal-hydrogenation, first-automobile	Science: Chemistry	One of the difficulties in automotive engineering was that of getting the gasoline vapors to burn smoothly within the cylinder. If they burned too rapidly, there was too great an explosion and a resulting 'knock' in the engine. This was hard on the engine, disturbing to the ear, and wasted energy. In 1921, however, the American chemist Thomas Midgley, Jr. (1889-1944) discovered that if the compound tetraethyl lead was added to the gasoline, it inhibited the burning just enough to prevent knock. It was an antiknock compound. From that time on, one could speak of 'ethyl gas' or of 'leaded gasoline.' A bromine compound was also added to the gasoline, to prevent accumulation of lead in the cylinder. It meant that the relatively volatile compound lead bromide was formed and discharged through the exhaust. This added another factor to the air pollution produced by automobiles.		
introvert-and-extrovert	1921	Introvert and extrovert	The concepts of introvert and extrovert were popularized, describing individuals whose interests are directed inward and outward, respectively. These terms have become fundamental in understanding personality types in psychology.	Carl Gustav Jung	Switzerland	psychoanalysis	Science: Psychology	Freud, who devised psychoanalysis, had a number of colleagues, with whom he always managed to quarrel. Those colleagues went on to found psychoanalytic schools of their own and to add refinements to psychoanalytic theory. Thus the Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler popularized the notion of the inferiority complex in 1911. In 1921 the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) popularized the concepts of introvert, for a person whose thoughts and interests are directed inward, and extrovert, for a person whose thoughts and interests are concentrated on other people and the outside world.		
rorschach-test	1921	Rorschach test	The Rorschach test was invented to diagnose psychopathological conditions using symmetrical inkblots that patients interpret. This test became a widely known psychological evaluation tool.	Herrmann Rorschach	Switzerland	psychoanalysis	Science: Psychology	Psychoanalysis generally involves conversation between the patient and the psychiatrist, with the patient usually doing most of the talking. In 1921, however, a Swiss psychiatrist, Herrmann Rorschach (1884-1922), invented a nonconversational device for diagnosing psychopathological conditions. This involved the use of ten symmetrical inkblots, which patients were asked to interpret—to give their notion of what the abstract images represented. This Rorschach test became well known to the general public, although as with psychoanalytic techniques generally, it is difficult to tell objectively how useful it is.		
sumeria	1922	Sumeria	Excavations introduced the ancient civilization of Sumeria, probably the first civilization on Earth located in southern Iraq. Geological evidence of a great flood was found, stimulating further study of early civilizations.	Leonard Woolley	England	literature	Science: Archaeology	From the Greek histories and from Biblical accounts, modern historians knew something of Babylonian and Assyrian history, but archaeological investigations had to be depended on to delve back earlier still. In 1922 the English archaeologist Leonard Woolley (1880-1960) began his investigations along the course of the lower Euphrates River, particularly at what seemed to be the site of Ur, a very early city mentioned in chapter 11 of Genesis. His excavations introduced moderns to the ancient civilization of Sumeria in what is now southern Iraq. Sumeria was probably the first civilization on Earth; it is the Sumerians who invented writing. Woolley’s most startling finding was geological evidence of a great flood that must have spread devastation through Sumeria about 2800 B.C. It was this flood that gave rise to the flood story in the epic of Gilgamesh (see 2500 B.C.) and to the biblical account of Noah’s flood. Woolley’s findings were a great stimulus to the further study of early civilizations.		
tutankhamens-tomb	1922	Tutankhamen's tomb	By 1000 BC, every tomb except Tut's had been pillaged. Nowan archaeological expedition uncovered the first signs of Tutankhamen's tomb, revealing a treasure trove of ancient Egyptian artifacts.	George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, Howard Carter	England	hieroglyphics	Science: Archaeology	A British archaeological expedition under George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, Earl of Carnarvon, and Howard Carter found the first sign of the entrance to Tutankhamen's tomb on November 4, 1922. Three days later they reached the sealed burial chamber, uncovering a rich treasure trove of ancient Egyptian artifacts.		
vitamin-e	1922	Vitamin E	Nutritionists were conducting experiments, placing animals on limited diets to find new disorders caused by bad diets. A limited diet rendering rats sterile was corrected by certain foods, indicating the existence of a new, fat-soluble vitamin, later known as Vitamin E. 	Herbert McLean Evans	United States	vitamins-a-and-b	Science: Biology	In 1922 the American anatomist Herbert McLean Evans, who four years earlier had determined that human cells contained twenty-four pairs of chromosomes (actually twenty-three, it was later shown), found a limited diet that rendered rats sterile and that could be corrected by fresh lettuce, wheat germ, or dried alfalfa but not by already known vitamins. As a result, it looked as if another vitamin (later known as vitamin E) existed, one that was fat-soluble, as were vitamins A and D.		
growth-hormone	1922	Growth hormone	An extract of the pituitary gland was found to promote gigantism in rats, indicating the presence of a growth hormone. This discovery advanced knowledge in endocrinology and growth regulation.	Herbert McLean Evans	United States	hormones	Science: Biology	Evans, the discoverer of vitamin E (see above), also showed in 1922 that an extract of the pituitary gland (which is attached to the lower surface of the brain) served to promote gigantism in rats, making them grow to a significantly larger size than normal. That indicated the presence of a growth hormone in the pituitary.		
lysozyme	1922	Lysozyme	An enzyme called lysozyme was isolated from tears and mucus, showing bactericidal properties. It marked the first discovery of a human enzyme with such properties, contributing to the understanding of natural antibacterial agents.	Alexander Fleming	Scotland	bacteriophages, enzyme	Science: Biology	In 1922 the Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming isolated an enzyme called lysozyme from tears and mucus. He found it to have bactericidal (bacteria-destroying) properties. It was the first example of a human enzyme that had such properties, representing a time when more powerful natural products would be found.		
origin-of-life	1922	Origin of life	Darwin's evolution had made great inroads by now, but how did it all begin? Spontaneous generation was disproven by Pasteur in 1860, and the subject of a naturalistic genesis of life was too controversial, except in Soviet Russia which had disavowed of religion. Oparin suggested that life developed from a slow buildup of organic substances from simple compounds found in the primordial ocean and atmosphere.	Alexander Ivanovich Oparin	Russia	spontaneous-generation-rip	Science: Biology			
electric-nerve-fibers	1922	Electric nerve fibers	Electric currents in nerves were studied in detail with the aid of Braun's oscilloscope. The velocity of nerve impulses was shown to vary directly with the thickness of the nerve fiber.	Joseph Erlanger, Herbert Spencer Gasser	United States	oscilloscope, vagusstoffe, nerve-fibers	Science: Biology	The electric currents in nerves are tiny, so tiny that it was difficult to study them in detail. The American physiologists Joseph Erlanger (1874–1965) and Herbert Spencer Gasser (1888–1963) developed delicate methods of detection using Braun’s oscilloscope (see 1897) to aid in the studies. Beginning in 1922, they determined the rates at which nerve fibers conducted their impulses and showed that the velocity of the impulse varied directly with the thickness of the fiber. For this, the two men shared the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1944.		
expanding-universe-model	1922	Expanding universe model	A mathematician showed that solving equations for a universe containing mass still results in natural expansion. This discovery supported earlier suggestions about the expanding Universe.	Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann	Russia	expanding-universe-theory	Space	In 1922 the Russian mathematician Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann (1888–1925) went further. Solving the equations for a Universe containing mass, he showed that it too would naturally expand.		
waves-as-particles	1923	Waves as particles	Demonstrated that X rays scattered by matter have increased wavelengths, known as the Compton effect. This was a clear demonstration of the particle aspects of an energetic wave, and Compton began referring to this aspect as photons.	Arthur Holly Compton	United States	x-ray-wavelength	Science: Physics	In 1923 the American physicist Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) showed that X rays scattered by matter tended to lengthen their waves. This was called the Compton effect. Compton was able to account for this by presuming that when a quantum of X rays struck an electron, the electron recoiled, subtracting some energy from the quantum and therefore increasing its wavelength. This was a clear demonstration of the particle aspects of an energetic wave, and indeed, it was Compton who now began to refer to such waves in their particle aspects as photons.		
particles-as-waves	1923	Particles as waves	Proposed that all particles have wave properties, termed as matter-waves. Thus, all objects had both wave and particle aspects. When energy was low, the wave aspect would predominate. When energy was high, the particle aspect would dominate.	Louis-Victor-Pierre-Raymond de Broglie	France	waves-as-particles	Science: Physics	Even as Compton was demonstrating that waves showed particle properties (see above), the French physicist Louis-Victor-Pierre-Raymond de Broglie (1892-1987) was maintaining that, from theoretical considerations, every particle ought also to have an associated matter-wave and therefore show wave properties. The wavelength of such matter-waves would be inversely related to the momentum of the particle (that is, its mass times its velocity). A massive particle such as a baseball, or even a proton, would have matter-waves of such ultra-short wavelengths that they would be difficult or impossible to detect. Electrons, however, should have matter-waves with wavelengths similar to those of X rays. Increasingly, after the work of Compton and de Broglie, physicists began to take the view that all objects had both wave and particle aspects. Where energy was low (and mass is a form of energy), the wave aspect would predominate, and where energy was high, the particle aspect would predominate. To be sure, de Broglie's work was strictly theoretical. An actual demonstration of matter-waves would not come for several years, after which de Broglie would be awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1929.		
debye-huckel-equations	1923	Debye-Huckel equations	Explained why some compounds appeared to be partially dissociated in solution due to ion attractions. Provided equations to describe this behavior, modifying previous theories of electrolytic dissociation.	Peter Joseph William Debye, Erich Huckel	Germany	ionic-dissociation, x-ray-diffraction	Science: Chemistry	When Arrhenius had worked out the theory of electrolytic dissociation (see 1884), it seemed clear that some compounds dissociated only partially on solution. As crystal structure was elucidated by X-ray scattering (see 1912), however, it appeared that many compounds existed in totally dissociated form even in crystals. Why, then, should they seem to be only partially dissociated in solution? The answer to this question was proposed in 1923 by the Dutch-American physical chemist Peter Joseph William Debye (1884-1966), in collaboration with a German chemist, Erich Huckel (1896-1980). Debye and Huckel worked out sets of equations showing that the attractions between positive and negative ions in the solution modified the behavior of the ions compared with their behavior in pure water in such a way as to simulate partial recombination. Such ions, therefore, acted as though they were only partially dissociated.		
acid-base-pairs	1923	Acid-base pairs	At this point, acids were defined as substances that split up to yeild Hydrogen ions (H+), but bases yielded Hydroxyl ions (OH-). Brønsted suggested a more general definition in which whenever a proton transfers from one molecule to another, there is an acid-base pair involved; the acid gives up its protons and base accepts it.	Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted	Denmark	ionic-dissociation	Science: Chemistry	After the notion of ionic dissociation was established by Arrhenius, an acid came to be defined as a substance that split up to yield hydrogen ions, while a base was one that split up to yield hydroxyl ions (OH3-). These neutralized each other, because hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions combined to form neutral water molecules. The Danish chemist Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted (1879-1947) suggested a more general definition in 1923. An acid didn’t simply give up a hydrogen ion, because as a proton, it could not exist loose in solution. The proton, once it broke free of the acid molecule, must promptly attach itself to another molecule. Therefore, chemists ought to speak of acid-base pairs. Whenever a proton transferred from one molecule to another, the one that gave up the proton was an acid, the one that accepted it was a base. This broadened the concept and made it more useful.		
coenzyme-structure	1923	Coenzyme structure	The chemical structure of Harden’s coenzyme was worked out in relation to nucleotides making up nucleic acids. It received the name diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and had a complex six-atom ring structure which did not occur in living tissue except in this coenzyme and its relatives.	Hans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin	Germany	coenzyme	Science: Chemistry	Harden had shown that the yeast enzyme that fermented sugar had a nonprotein portion, which he called a coenzyme (see 1904). The chemical structure of that coenzyme was unknown, however. It was not until 1923 that a German chemist, Hans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin (1873-1964), solved that problem and worked out the structure of Harden’s coenzyme. The structure was related to that of the nucleotides that formed the building blocks of nucleic acid molecules. It received the name of diphosphopyridine nucleotide. The most interesting thing about the molecule was that a portion of it, when broken off, proved to be the well-known chemical compound nicotinamide, which could easily be changed to nicotinic acid. Euler-Chelpin was awarded a share (with Harden) of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1929.		
cepheids-in-andromeda	1923	Cepheids in andromeda	The Andromeda nebula was studied using a 100-inch telescope and ordinary stars were identified within it. Although Hubble's estimate that Andromeda was 750,000 ly away turned out to be an underestimate, it was still far enough to be well outside our galaxy. The general structure of the Universe came to be understood, and it was far greater than previously thought.	Edwin Powell Hubble	United States	100-inch-telescope, novas-in-andromeda, cepheid-variables	Space	Three years earlier, Curtis had debated Shapley over whether the Andromeda nebula was a distant galaxy (see 1920). The still-new 100-inch telescope offered a way of settling the matter. The American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble (1889-1953) used it in 1923 to study the Andromeda nebula and managed to make out some ordinary stars (not novas) in it. Some of these stars were		
hafnium	1923	Hafnium	Hevesy and Coster discovered the element hafnium using X ray analysis. Hafnium is similar to zirconium and difficult to separate due to their association.	George de Hevesy and Dirk Coster	Hungary and Netherlands	x-ray-diffraction	Science: Chemistry	Hevesy, who had introduced the notion of radioactive tracers (see 1918), managed to reduce further the small number of still missing elements. In collaboration with a Dutch physicist, Dirk Coster (1889–1950), Hevesy used an X-ray analysis method worked out by Coster and discovered hafnium, from the Latin name for Copenhagen. It is not a particularly rare element, but it is very like zirconium, which is just above it in the periodic table, and it is never found except in association with zirconium, which is fifty times as common, so that hafnium is hard to separate out.		
ultracentrifuge	1923	Ultracentrifuge	The ultracentrifuge, developed by Svedberg, is capable of generating 7,000 g (at 12,000 rpm) to separate particles like proteins and measure their molecular weights with high accuracy. This invention significantly advanced the study of proteins and biological molecules.	Theodor Svedberg	Sweden	ultramicroscope, electric-motors	Science: Chemistry	Materials that ordinarily remain in suspension in water, due to the incessant battering of surrounding molecules, can be made to settle out by means of a centrifugal effect. Instruments called centrifuges whirl suspensions and force the suspended material to the side of the vessel away from the center of rotation. In this way, red blood corpuscles can be separated from blood, and cream from milk. (Since cream is less dense than the watery portion of milk, it collects on the inner side of the vessel, closer to the center of rotation.) Ordinary centrifuges do not produce effects large enough to force colloidal particles smaller than red blood corpuscles or droplets of cream to settle out. But the Swedish chemist The Svedberg (1884–1971) developed an ultracentrifuge in 1923, which spun so quickly it developed effects equivalent to a gravity hundreds of thousands of times normal. At such high rates of spin, the centrifugal effect can force ordinary protein molecules to settle out, and since mixtures of different types of proteins settle at different rates (the greater the molecular weight, the faster the rate of settling), different proteins can to some extent be separated in this way. The rate of settling allowed the molecular weights of proteins to be determined with reasonable accuracy, and for this work Svedberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1926.		
australopithecus	1924	Australopithecus	Discovery of an Australopithecus skull revealed a small primitive hominid, capable of upright walking and a closer relation to humans than to apes. These remain the earliest known hominids.	Arthur Dart	South Africa	java-man	Science: Biology	Arthur Dart (1893–1988), examined it and recognized it as a primitive hominid. He called it Australopithecus, which is Greek for "southern ape." It was not an ape, however, for subsequent discoveries of several species of such australopithecines showed that they walked upright and were closer to modern humans than to any apes, modern or past. They are the earliest hominids, as far as we can now tell.		
bose-einstein-statistics	1924	Bose-einstein statistics	Bose-Einstein statistics is a method for handling subatomic particles, applicable to bosons, particles named in honor of Bose. This statistical framework aids in understanding particle behavior in quantum mechanics.	Satyendra Nath Bose	India	photoelectric-effect-and-quanta	Science: Physics	In 1924 the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose (1894–1974) worked out a statistical method of handling certain subatomic particles. Einstein was enthusiastic about this and generalized Bose’s work the next year. The resulting Bose-Einstein statistics may be used with any of a group of subatomic particles called bosons in Bose’s honor. The best-known example of a boson is the photon.		
ionosphere	1924	Ionosphere	Appleton experimented transmitting to a receiver 70 miles away, varying wavelengths of the signal to measure reflections from the atmosphere. He found that the Kennelly-Heaviside layer was 50 miles high and most active at night. He also discovered a higher charged layer called the Appleton layers which were 150 miles high.	Edward Victor Appleton	England	kennelly-heaviside-layer	Science: Physics	Heaviside and Kennelly had predicted the existence of regions in the upper atmosphere that contained charged ions and that reflected radio waves (see 1902). Details concerning this		
cytochrome	1924	Cytochrome	Studying the muscles of a horse botfly, Keilin noticed absorption bands that disappeared after shaking but reappeared afterward. He suggested that there must be a substance responsible for absorbing oxygen in cells, discovered it, and named it cytochrome. This finding enhanced understanding of cellular oxygen absorption processes.	David Keilin	England	hemoglobin	Science: Biology	Russian-born British biochemist David Keilin discovered cytochrome while studying the absorption spectrum of the horse botfly. He observed bands that appeared when cell suspension was not oxygenated and disappeared when it was shaken in air. Keilin concluded that a substance in cells is responsible for absorbing oxygen.		
irradiation	1924	Irradiation	Vitamin D was rarely found in food. But it was known that sunshine converted an inactive precursor in skin to vitamin D. Steenbock showed that some food could be exposed to sunlight in order to produce vitamin D, making irradiated food a common occurrence.	Harry Steenbock	United States	rickets	Science: Biology	Vitamin D is not often to be found, as such, in food. However, it was known that sunshine converted an inactive precursor in the skin to vitamin D (see 1921). It followed that similar inactive precursors of vitamin D might exist in food, which exposure to sunlight (irradiation) might produce. The American biochemist Harry Steenbock (1886-1967) showed in 1924 that this was, in fact, the case, and the use of irradiated food grew common.		
packing-fraction	1925	Packing fraction	Aston's mass spectrograph determined accurate masses of isotopes, revealing slight discrepancies from integers. These were explained by the way that subatomic particles were arranged in a nucleus. If one kind of nucleus was converted into a more tickly packed one, mass would be lost and large amounts of energy produced.	Francis William Aston	England	mass-spectrometer, mass-energy, hydrogen-helium-conversion	Science: Physics	Six years earlier, Aston had used his mass spectrograph to determine the mass and relative occurrence of the isotopes of various stable elements (see 1919). Out of the 257 stable isotopes we now know to exist, he obtained the masses of 212. By 1925 Aston had brought his mass spectrograph to such a pitch of accuracy that he was able to show that the mass numbers of the individual isotopes were actually very slightly different from integers, sometimes a little above, sometimes a little below. These slight discrepancies occurred because forming the nuclei from the individual subatomic particles that made them up absorbed or produced energy, and this energy was the equivalent of tiny bits of mass lost or gained in accordance with Einstein’s equation relating mass and energy (see 1905, Mass-Energy). The energy change produced by packing together subatomic particles in a nucleus was called the packing fraction. Since it represented the energy binding the particles together, it could also be called the binding energy. This meant that if one type of nucleus was converted into another kind of nucleus with a tighter packing, mass would be lost and energy produced on a far larger scale per particle than was produced in ordinary chemical reactions involving the outer electrons of an atom. This made sense out of Harkins’s contention that hydrogen-to-helium conversion would produce a great deal of energy (see 1915) and generalized it to nuclear reactions as a whole. It also explained the energy of alpha particles. When an atom broke down		
exclusion-principle	1925	Exclusion principle	Bohr and Sommerfeld worked out the energy levels of the electrons in an atom and expressed them as quantum numbers, three of which were known at the time. Pauli suggested a fourth, and the exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in a system can have identical sets of quantum numbers.	Wolfgang Pauli	United States	quantized-atom	Science: Physics	The Austrian-born American physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) considered the matter and felt that there was need for a fourth quantum number. If that were allowed according to certain rules, then it would be possible to show that no two electrons in a particular system of electrons could have all four quantum numbers alike. In other words, if a particular electron in an atom had one of the four quantum numbers, all the other electrons would be excluded from having that number. This was called the exclusion principle, and it allowed the arrangement of electrons in any atom to be worked out. It also explained why Mendeleyev's periodic table (see 1869) took the form it did. For the exclusion principle, Pauli was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1945.		
particle-spin	1925	Particle spin	Physicists realized that the fourth quantum number indicates particle spin, which can be +½ or -½. This concept was applied to particles like electrons and later found to apply to other particles as well.	George Eugene Uhlenbeck, Samuel Abraham Goudsmit	Netherlands	exclusion-principle	Science: Physics	Once Pauli had enunciated the exclusion principle (see above), two Dutch physicists, George Eugene Uhlenbeck (1900-1988) and Samuel Abraham Goudsmit (1902-1978), at once pointed out that the fourth quantum number that Pauli had decided was required could be interpreted neatly as particle spin. Each particle, such as an electron, could spin either clockwise or counterclockwise at a rate that could be expressed as +½ or -½. Eventually, similar spins (equal to ½ or some multiple thereof) were found to exist for almost all other particles.		
matrix-mechanics	1925	Matrix mechanics	Matrix mechanics is a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics that manipulates energy levels without regard for their physical representation. It was developed to interpret spectral lines more accurately.	Werner Karl Heisenberg	Germany	quantized-atom	Science: Physics	The German physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-1976) considered all this useless and misleading. He preferred to take the numbers representing the energy level and manipulate them without regard to their pictured significance. In 1925 he developed a form of manipulation called matrix mechanics for the purpose.		
magnetism-and-absolute-zero	1925	Magnetism and absolute zero	The very cold temperature of 0.5°K was reached, advancing the study of low-temperature physics and magnetism. Additionally, it was theorized that by placing a paramagnetic substance in contact with this liquid helium into a magnetic field, the temperature should consistently drop even lower. This remained untested for another decade.	Willem Hendrik Keesom	Netherlands	liquid-helium	Science: Physics	The Dutch physicist Willem Hendrik Keesom (1876-1956) had managed to reach a temperature of 0.5.		
gravitational-red-shift	1925	Gravitational red shift	A red shift in the light spectrum of a tiny star was detected, supporting Einstein's theory of general relativity. This observation showed that light loses energy and reddens when rising in a strong gravitational field.	Walter Sydney Adams	United States	gravitational-deflection-of-light, general-relativity	Science: Physics	In 1925 Adams managed to study the spectrum of the tiny star and detected a red shift close enough to that predicted by Einstein to be considered evidence of the validity of the theory of general relativity. As in the case of the bending starlight, however, it was a borderline observation.		
rhenium	1925	Rhenium	A new element with the atomic number 75 was discovered and named rhenium. It was the last element with stable isotopes to be found. They also claimed to have discovered element 43, which they named masurium, but this was a mistake.	Walter Karl Friedrich Noddack, Ida Eva Tacke	Germany	isotopes, atomic-number	Science: Chemistry	In 1925 two German chemists, Walter Karl Friedrich Noddack and Ida Eva Tacke, detected a new element with the atomic number of 75. They named it rhenium, after the Latin name of the Rhine river.		
morphine-synthesis	1925	Morphine synthesis	Morphine was synthesized, and its exact structure was deduced. This accomplishment demonstrated advanced techniques in molecular synthesis and structural analysis.	Robert Robinson	England	morphine, organic-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	An English chemist, Robert Robinson (1886–1975), was particularly skillful at synthesizing complex molecules, and in 1925 he synthesized morphine. From the methods of the synthesis, he could deduce its exact structure, atom for atom.		
parathormone	1925	Parathormone	Parathormone was isolated from the parathyroids, which regulates calcium metabolism. This discovery contributed to the understanding and treatment of calcium-related metabolic disorders.	James Bertram Collip	Canada	thyroxine	Science: Biology	The thyroid gland was known to produce a hormone that regulated metabolic activity (see 1915). Embedded within it were four small glands called the parathyroids, which regulated calcium metabolism. In 1925 the Canadian biochemist James Bertram Collip (1892–1965) isolated from the parathyroids an extract that contained the hormone, which was named parathormone.		
iron-and-cytochrome	1925	Iron and Cytochrome	It was shown that cytochrome enzymes possess the same iron-containing heme group as hemoglobin. This finding enhanced the understanding of cellular respiration mechanisms.	Otto Heinrich Warburg	Germany	cytochrome	Science: Biology	Keilin had earlier demonstrated the existence of cytochromes within the cell—a series of enzymes that combined oxygen atoms with pairs of hydrogen atoms (see 1924). A German biochemist, Otto Heinrich Warburg (1883–1970), was studying the cytochromes and noticed that carbon monoxide attached itself to them in the same way that they attached themselves to hemoglobin. In 1925 Warburg showed that the cytochromes possessed the same iron-containing heme group that hemoglobin did.		
wave-mechanics	1926	Wave mechanics	Wave mechanics views electrons as waves rather than particles, providing a coherent explanation for electron orbits. Schrödinger synthesized a lot of previous work from Maxwell, Broglie, Bohr, Heisenberg, and developed the mathematical basis for this theory, known as the Schrödinger wave equation.	Erwin Schrödinger	Austria	particles-as-waves, elliptical-electron-orbits, matrix-mechanics	Science: Physics	Three years earlier, de Broglie had suggested that particles such as electrons might have wave aspects (see 1923). In 1926 an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1961), decided that if the electron was viewed as a wave rather than as a particle, Bohr's electron orbits (see 1913 and 1915) might make more sense. Schrödinger imagined an atom in which the electron could be in any orbit, provided that its matter-waves would extend around that orbit in an integral number of wavelengths. This would produce a standing wave and therefore would not represent an electric charge in oscillation. The electron, as long as it remained in such an orbit, need not radiate light and would not violate the conditions of Maxwell's equations (see 1865). Furthermore, the permissible orbits worked out by Bohr and others all involved whole wavelengths, and the lowest orbit was one that involved a single wavelength. In this way, Bohr's suggestions came to make solid sense. This view of Schrödinger's was called wave mechanics, and it was soon shown to be mathematically equivalent to Heisenberg's matrix mechanics of the year before (see 1925). However, Schrödinger's waves seemed the more attractive idea of the two, because they did offer the mind a picture of the atom. Schrödinger worked out the mathematical underpinnings of wave mechanics; a key relationship that he presented is known as the Schrödinger wave equation. For his work on wave mechanics, Schrödinger was awarded a share (along with Dirac—see 1930) of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1933.		
wave-packets	1926	Wave packets	Wave packets introduce a probabilistic interpretation of electron wave behavior, suggesting that wave peaks indicate electron presence probability. Max Born's work helped solidify quantum mechanics' theoretical foundation.	Max Born	Germany	particles-as-waves	Science: Physics	Like Schrödinger (see above), the German physicist Max Born (1882-1970) tried to work out the implications of the electron viewed as a wave. He gave electron waves a probabilistic interpretation: the rise and fall of waves could be taken to indicate the rise and fall in probability that the electron behaved as though it was a particle existing at those points in the wave packet. He also worked on the mathematical basis of such a view. He, Schrödinger, and Heisenberg (see 1925) may be viewed as the inventors of quantum mechanics, which ever since has been used to interpret chemistry and subatomic physics with remarkable success. Quantum mechanics and Einstein's relativity (see 1905 and 1916) are the two great theoretical foundations of twentieth-century physics. For his work on quantum mechanics, Born was		
fermi-dirac-statistics	1926	Fermi-dirac statistics	Pauli's exclusion principle showed that Bose-Einstein statistics only applied to particles with integral spins, not those with half-value spins like protons and electrons. New statistics called Fermi-Dirac were developed for these particles, now known as fermions. Particles like protons and electron are called fermions in honor of Fermi.	Enrico Fermi	Italy	bose-einstein-statistics, exclusion-principle	Science: Physics	Bose and Einstein had worked out the Bose-Einstein statistics a year earlier, but the statistics now turned out to hold only for those particles (like the photon) that had spins of integral values: 0, 1, 2, and so on. Particles like the proton and electron had spins of half-values: ½, 1½, and so on. Once Pauli had worked out the exclusion principle (see 1925) for particles with half-value spins, it was clear that Bose-Einstein wouldn't work for particles with such spins. A new set of statistics would therefore have to be worked out. Taking the lead in working out that problem, in 1926, was an Italian physicist, Enrico Fermi (1901—1954). Dirac (see 1930) also contributed, so that the result is known as the Fermi-Dirac statistics. All particles subject to these statistics, like the proton and electron, are called fermions in honor of Fermi.		
galactic-rotation	1926	Galactic rotation	Analysis of star streams led to the conclusion that the Galaxy rotates about its center. This discovery was confirmed independently by researchers in Sweden and the Netherlands.	Bertil Lindblad and Jan Hendrik Oort	Sweden and Netherlands	star-streams	Space	Twenty-two years before, Kapteyn had observed that there were two star streams moving in opposite directions (see 1904). In 1926 the Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad (1895—1965), analyzing these motions carefully, showed that they were just what would be expected if we viewed the Galaxy as rotating about its center. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort (b. 1900) came to the same conclusion.		
liquid-fuel-rockets	1926	Liquid-fuel rockets	The introduction of liquid fuel and carrying its own oxidizer made rockets more powerful and controllable. Goddard's first rocket flew 200 ft into the air, and marked the beginning of modern rocketry and expanded human reach beyond the atmosphere. 	Robert Hutchings Goddard	United States	laws-motion, gunpowder, space-flight	Science: Physics	The Chinese had made use of rockets in the Middle Ages, and Isaac Newton, with his law of action and reaction (see 1687), had shown that rockets were one way of traveling through outer space. Until the twentieth century, however, rockets had made use of gunpowder as the fuel and had depended on the atmosphere for oxygen. A crucial change was introduced by the American physicist Robert Hutchings Goddard (1882-1945). He had been interested in rocketry since his teens, and it occurred to him that a rocket would be more powerful and under better control if it made use of a liquid fuel such as gasoline and carried its own oxidizer in the form of liquid oxygen. On March 16, 1926, Goddard fired his first liquid-fuel rocket. It was about 4 feet high, 6 inches in diameter, and was held in a frame like a child's jungle gym. It rose 200 feet into the air. It didn't seem like much, but that little rocket marked the first step in the expansion of the human range beyond the atmosphere.		
enzyme-crystallization	1926	Enzyme crystallization	To prove whether enzymes were proteins or not, Sumner prepared very concentrated solutions and found that crystals of that same enzyme would form spontaneously. This was the first time enzymes were crystallized and therefore quite pure, and could be studied in great detail.	James Batcheller Sumner	United States	cellulose, magnesium-and-chlorophyll	Science: Biology	Although Payen had isolated an enzyme for the first time nearly a century before (see 1833), scientists still didn't understand the chemical nature of enzymes. From the fact that enzyme action could be destroyed by gentle heating, it might be supposed that enzymes were proteins. However, Willstatter (see 1906) had purified enzyme solutions as far as he could while still retaining the enzyme action and had then subjected these solutions to all manner of chemical analysis. He had found no convincing evidence that enzymes were proteins. In 1926, however, the American biochemist James Batcheller Sumner (b. 1887) obtained the enzymes in a solid form by crystallizing them from solution. Careful tests showed that his crystallized enzymes were proteins after all, and their protein nature was finally established.		
pernicious-anemia	1926	Pernicious anemia	A liver diet was found to be an effective treatment for a deadly type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Asimov writes "It wasn't pleasant, eating quantities of liver for indefinite periods, but it delayed death."	George Richards Minot	United States	anemia	Science: Medicine	Pernicious anemia, a particularly deadly form of anemia, was investigated by American physician George Richards Minot, who, recalling that liver was helpful in treating ordinary anemia, hypothesized it might help with pernicious anemia as well. Minot and his assistant William Parry Murphy put anemia patients on a liver diet, and by 1926 had demonstrated its success. This treatment method led Minot and Murphy, along with George Whipple, to be awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1934.		
uncertainty-principle	1927	Uncertainty principle	The Uncertainty Principle established that one cannot simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a subatomic particle. Planck's constant represented a fundamental graininess to the universe, and its discovery implied fundamental limits to measurement and explains various phenomena in quantum mechanics. 	Werner Heisenberg	Germany	quanta	Science: Physics	It had always been assumed by scientists that given enough patience, enough delicacy, and the proper instruments, any and all properties of anything observable could be measured to any degree of accuracy. It seemed axiomatic. In 1927, however, Heisenberg (see 1925) showed that a careful consideration of quantum mechanics proved this to be wrong. One could determine, for instance, the momentum of a subatomic particle to any degree of precision, and the position of a subatomic particle to any degree of precision, but one could not determine both at the same time to any degree of precision. The more closely you determined a particle’s momentum, the less certain you could be of its position, and vice versa. (The same was true if you tried to determine both the energy content of a particle and the exact time at which you were trying to observe it.) The uncertainty in the knowledge of momentum multiplied by the uncertainty in the knowledge of position was equal to Planck’s constant (see 1900). Planck’s constant represented, so to speak, the graininess of the Universe. It seemed that if you tried to inspect the Universe very closely indeed, you would come up against the grain and could detect nothing finer than that. It was rather like trying to magnify a photograph made up of tiny patches of dark and light. Under ordinary conditions, the picture looks smooth and well defined. Magnify it sufficiently, though, and the tiny patches expand till the picture seems to be a chaos of meaningless light and dark. You have reached the limits of magnification and of further information. Heisenberg had discovered the uncertainty principle. At first glance, it would seem to negate any hope scientists might have of discovering "truth" to the finest detail, but looked at in another way, the uncertainty principle is how the Universe works, and its existence as a limitation explains many facets of the Universe that would be meaningless if that limitation did not exist. For example, to explain why helium doesn’t freeze at ordinary pressures, even at absolute zero, requires a line of reasoning in which the uncertainty principle plays an essential part. It was for this principle that Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1932.		
electron-diffraction	1927	Electron diffraction	Electron Diffraction confirmed that electrons exhibit wave-like behavior, as evidenced by a diffraction pattern when electrons are scattered by a crystalline structure. This discovery supports the wave-particle duality concept in quantum mechanics.	Clinton Joseph Davisson	United States	particles-as-waves	Science: Physics	De Broglie had suggested that electrons and indeed all particles had wave aspects (see 1923). No one since, however, had actually caught a particle behaving like a wave. An American physicist, Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881–1958), however, was studying the reflection of electrons from a metallic nickel target enclosed in a vacuum tube. The tube shattered by accident, and the heated nickel promptly developed a film of oxide that made it useless as a target. To remove the film, Davisson heated the nickel for long periods. This caused the nickel to form large, clean, perfect crystals. When Davisson bombarded these crystals with electrons, he obtained a diffraction pattern, showing that the electrons were being scattered by groups of atoms in the crystal lattice, in the same fashion that X-rays were scattered in the phenomena of X-ray diffraction (see 1912).		
speed-of-light-michelson	1927	Speed of light	In the California mountains, Michelson surveyed a 22-mile distance between two mountain peaks to an accuracy of less than an inch. A new measurement of the speed of light achieved high precision using an eight-sided revolving mirror. The determined speed was 199,798 km/s, 6 km/s faster than our modern estimate.	Albert Abraham Michelson	United States	speed-of-light-interferometer, speed-of-light-experiment	Science: Physics	In his last years, Michelson, who had performed the fateful Michelson-Morley experiment (see 1887), grew interested in measuring the speed of light with new precision. In the California mountains, he surveyed a 22-mile distance between two mountain peaks to an accuracy of less than an inch. He made use of a special eight-sided revolving mirror to reflect a light beam in the fashion used by Foucault (see 1849). In 1927 he obtained a value of 199,798 kilometers per second for the speed of light. This was only about 6 kilometers per second faster than the figure determined nowadays by much more sophisticated equipment.		
cosmic-egg	1927	Cosmic egg	Theoretical concept suggesting the Universe expanded from a single point of origin called the Cosmic Egg. This idea introduced the theory of the Big Bang as the beginning of the expanding Universe.	Georges-Henri Lemaître	Belgium	expanding-universe-model	Space	Friedmann had developed the theoretical concept of an expanding universe (see 1917), and in 1927 the Belgian astrophysicist Georges-Henri Lemaître (1894-1966) drew what seemed a natural conclusion. If the Universe was expanding as time went forward, then if we imagined the situation reversed and looked back in time, we should see the Universe contracting. (It would be as though we had taken a film of the expanding Universe and were running it backward.) If we looked forward, the Universe might well expand forever, but if we look backward, the contraction had to be limited. Eventually, at a point far enough back in time, all the matter of the Universe would be compressed into one relatively small body, which Lemaître called the cosmic egg. This cosmic egg apparently exploded in what came to be called the big bang and started the expanding Universe that now exists. Of course, Lemaître could offer no scientific explanation of where the cosmic egg came from and just how its explosion led to the present Universe. Physicists have been trying to work that out ever since.		
electron-bonds	1927	Electron bonds	Quantum mechanics were applied to chemical bonds, with a focus on the hydrogen molecule. This work laid the foundation for understanding chemical bonding through quantum theory.	Fritz Wolfgang London, Walter Heitler	Germany	electrons-and-chemical-bonds, wave-mechanics, wave-packets	Science: Chemistry	Lewis had viewed chemical bonds as resulting from the transfer or sharing of electrons (see 1916). Now, immediately after Schrödinger and Born had worked out the mathematical underpinnings of quantum mechanics (see 1926), two German physicists, Fritz Wolfgang London (1900–1954) and Walter Heitler (b. 1904), tried to apply quantum mechanics to chemical bonds. In 1927 they took the simplest case, that of the hydrogen molecule. It consisted of two hydrogen atoms, each		
peking-man	1927	Peking man	Black was convinced that humanity's origins were in Asia and discovered a single human molar in a cave near Peking, which led to identifying a small-brained hominid named Peking Man. Later discoveries showed that Peking man was another example of Homo Erectus.	Davidson Black	Canada	java-man, australopithecus	Science: Biology	In 1927, in a cave at Cho-Ko'u-tien, 25 miles west of Peking, a Canadian anthropologist, Davidson Black, located a single human molar. From this tooth alone, he deduced the existence of a small-brained hominid, which he called Sinanthropus pekinensis (Greek for 'Chinese human of Peking') and popularly known as Peking Man. Later discoveries showed that Peking man was very similar to Java man, which Dubois had discovered (see 1890). Both are now considered examples of Homo erectus, a species that preceded Homo sapiens (ourselves and Neanderthal man), and which in turn was preceded by the australopithecines, which Dart had discovered (see 1924). Naturally the line of descent was not complete. Other discoveries remained to be made.		
x-rays-and-mutations	1927	X rays and mutations	Experiments showed that irradiating fruit flies with X rays significantly increased mutation rates, demonstrating the impact of X rays on genetic changes. This discovery highlighted both the potential for genetic research and the dangers of careless exposure to X rays and radioactive materials.	Hermann Joseph Muller	United States	fruit-flies, x-rays	Science: Genetics	Morgan (see 1907) had been working with the fruit fly for two decades, and one of his students was the American biologist Hermann Joseph Muller (1890-1967). Muller irradiated fruit flies with X rays and produced various mutations. In this composite insect, normal features are shown on the left, mutant ones on the right. To make the studies on fruit flies worthwhile, mutations had to occur, and so they did, but randomly and not often enough for Muller. He found, in 1919, that keeping the fruit flies at a higher temperature increased the mutation rate, and he decided that this might be so because at a higher temperature, the molecules in the genes vibrated more strongly and therefore were more likely to undergo spontaneous random change. If this were so, and if mutations were the result of molecular change, was there something that would bring them about faster than raising the temperature would? It occurred to him to try X rays. They were more energetic than gentle heat, and if they struck a gene they would certainly affect some atomic group. He made use of X rays, and by 1927 it was quite clear that they worked. The mutation rate went up sharply. This was not only useful from the standpoint of genetics. It became plain that most X-ray-induced mutations (and indeed, mutations induced in any fashion) were deleterious. This meant that X rays and radioactive radiations had the capacity to harm human beings who worked with them carelessly.		
m-and-n-blood-groups	1927	M and N blood groups	M and N blood groups were discovered, adding to the known blood group types. This discovery is not useful in transfusion but useful for studying heredity and distinguishing between different human groups.	Karl Landsteiner	Austria	blood-types	Science: Biology	Landsteiner had discovered the A, B, O series of blood groups and demonstrated their importance in blood transfusion (see 1900). He thought it was possible that other blood groups might exist that were not of importance to transfusion but that might still be of interest in studying heredity, distinguishing between geographically separated human groups, determining paternity questions, and so on. Thus in 1927 Landsteiner and his group discovered blood groups they designed as M, N, and MN.		
talking-pictures	1927	Talking pictures	Talking pictures were successfully introduced with the first hit "The Jazz Singer" starring Al Jolson marking the end of the silent film era. This innovation quickly spread, transforming the film industry with sound.			motion-pictures, radio-waves-and-sound	Culture	For a quarter-century, motion pictures had been an increasingly important amusement for the world, but in all that time they had been silent, accompanied only by the conventional use of a tinkling piano. By and large, the silent movies consisted of a dumb show, broken occasionally by title plates. Attempts had been made now and then to add sound to film, but the first true success came on October 6, 1927, with the opening of The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson. This new development spread with amazing rapidity, and in two or three years the silent movie was dead.		
penicillin	1928	Penicillin	Penicillin was discovered by accident when Fleming left a culture of staphylococcus germs uncovered for a few days. He noticed that an unknown mold killed the staphylococcus bacteria. Upon further study, he found that this mold did not affect Human cells. Although it took over a decade for further development, this antibiotic revolutionized medicine.	Alexander Fleming	Scotland	lysozyme	Science: Medicine	Some discoveries are made by accident. In 1928 Fleming, who had discovered lysozyme (see 1922), left a culture of staphylococcus germs uncovered for some days. He was through with it, actually, and was about to discard the dish containing the culture when he noticed that some specks of mold had fallen into it. Around every speck, the bacterial colony had dissolved away for a short distance. Bacteria had died and no new growth had invaded the area. Fleming isolated the mold and eventually identified it as one called Penicillium notatum, closely related to ordinary bread mold. He decided that it liberated some compound that, at the very least, inhibited growth, and he called the substance penicillin. Fleming tested the mold on various types of bacteria and found that some were affected and some were not. Human cells were not affected. He did not go further, and it was to be over a decade before scientists returned to the problem. Nevertheless, for this discovery, Fleming received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1945.		
diels-alder-reaction	1928	Diels-Alder reaction	The Diels-Alder reaction allows chemists to synthesize ring molecules, which are crucial in many fields, particularly in creating biologically interesting compounds. 	Otto Paul Hermann Diels and Kurt Alder	Germany	organic-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	Chemists who specialize in organic synthesis are delighted when they can find a chemical reaction that will put together atoms in some fashion and that will work under a variety of conditions. In 1928 two German chemists, Otto Paul Hermann Diels (1876–1954) and Kurt Alder (1902–1958), found a reaction that would join two compounds in such a way as to form a ring of atoms. This was properly a diene synthesis but came to be called the Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction was useful in synthesizing many compounds of biological interest, and as a result, the two chemists were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1950.		
raman-spectra	1928	Raman spectra	The Compton effect showed that X rays lengthened their wavelengths when diffracted. Heisenberg suspected this was true for all electromagnetic radiation, and Raman proved that this was so. The Raman spectrum of a molecule revealed fine details about its  molecular structure	Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman	India	waves-as-particles	Science: Physics	After Compton had discovered the Compton effect—that X rays tended to lengthen their waves when diffracted (see 1923)—Heisenberg (see 1925) pointed out, in 1925, that this ought to be true of any electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. That it was so in practice was shown in 1928 by the Indian physicist Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (1888– 1970). By demonstrating that scattered light had weak components of changed wavelengths, he showed that photons of visible light had particle aspects. Furthermore, the exact wavelengths produced in the scattering depended upon the nature of the molecules doing the scattering. For this reason, Raman spectra proved to be useful in determining some of the fine details of molecular structure. For his discovery, Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1930. He was the first Asian to win a Nobel Prize.		
game-theory	1928	Game theory	A new branch of mathematics concerning principles for finding the best strategies in games with fixed rules emerged. It was later applied to business, war, and scientific research.	John von Neumann	United States		Math	Neumann (1903-1957), in 1928, He began devising the principles of what came to be called game theory because it dealt with the best strategies to follow when playing simple games with fixed rules, such as coin-matching. The principles so developed could then be applied to far more complicated games, such as business or war, and an attempt made to work out the best strategy to beat a competitor or an enemy. Even scientific research can be considered a game, one in which scientists pit their wits against the impersonal Universe.		
hexuronic-acid	1928	Hexuronic acid	A substance from adrenal glands was isolated and named hexuronic acid due to its properties. It was later identified as rich in vitamin C.	Albert von Nagyrapolt Szent-Györgyi	Hungary	epinephrine, glutathione, scurvy	Science: Biochemistry	In 1928 the Hungarian-born American biochemist Albert von Nagyrapolt Szent-Györgyi (1893-1986), while working at Cambridge University under Hopkins (see 1900, Tryptophan), isolated a substance from adrenal glands that easily lost and regained a pair of hydrogen atoms and was therefore, like glutathione (see 1921), a hydrogen carrier. Since its molecules seemed to have six carbon atoms and since it had the properties of a sugar, Szent-Györgyi named it hexuronic acid. (The hex is from the Greek word for 'six' and the uronic is a common suffix for sugar-related compounds.) Szent-Györgyi also isolated the substance from cabbages and oranges, both rich in vitamin C, but it took him a while to decide that hexuronic acid was itself the vitamin.		
receding-galaxies	1929	Receding galaxies	The radial velocity of galaxies was measured, showing that most are receding from us, some at high speeds. Hubble observed that Galaxies receded from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us (Hubble's law). This observation confirmed the theory that the Universe is expanding.	Milton La Salle Humason	United States	nebular-velocities, expanding-universe-model	Space	The American astronomer Milton La Salle Humason measured the radial velocity of many galaxies and also found that all were receding from us, some at unusually large rates.		
solar-composition	1929	Solar composition	The Sun's composition was determined to be primarily hydrogen and helium (in a 3-to-1 mass ratio) with some oxygen, nitrogen, neon, and carbon. This turned out to be similar to the composition of the Universe as a whole, as nearly as astronomers can determine.	Henry Norris Russell	United States	hydrogen-in-the-sun	Space	The Solar spectrum was used to give a detailed picture of the Sun's composition, showing that it mainly consisted of hydrogen and helium in a 3-to-1 mass ratio, with minor components including oxygen, nitrogen, neon, and carbon.		
solar-energy	1929	Solar energy	The source of the Sun's energy was hypothesized to be related to nuclear reactions rather than gravitational shrinkage, as was hypothesized by Helmholtz. This process of nuclear fusion is the process where four hydrogen nuclei combine to form one helium nucleus.	George Gamow	United States	age-of-the-sun, solar-composition, radioactive-energy	Science: Physics	Helmholtz suggested the Sun's energy came from gravitationally induced shrinkage, but nuclear energy was later shown to be a likely solar power source.		
coincidence-counter	1929	Coincidence counter	The coincidence counter uses two Geiger counters to measure cosmic rays by ensuring events are recorded only when both counters simultaneously register a particle. Bothe used this technique to show that the laws of conservation of energy and of momentum were as valid for atoms as for billiard balls.	Walther Bothe	Germany	geiger-counter	Science: Physics	Walther Bothe devised a new method of studying cosmic rays using two Geiger counters placed above each other, setting up a circuit that recorded an event only if both counters registered it simultaneously.		
particle-accelerator	1929	Particle accelerator	To date, alpha particles were the most readily available to study, along with cosmic rays which were outside of human control. The particle accelerator uses a voltage multiplier and electromagnet to accelerate protons to high energy levels. This innovation allowed to manufacture energetic particle collisions on demand.	John Douglas Cockcroft, Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton	England	radioactive-energy	Science: Physics	John Douglas Cockcroft and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton devised a voltage multiplier capable of accelerating protons to the point where they contained more energy than alpha particles occurring in nature, the first particle accelerator or atom-smasher.		
oxygen-isotopes-and-atomic-weights	1929	Oxygen isotopes and atomic weights	It was discovered that oxygen atoms had three isotopes: oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18. This finding led to the selection of carbon-12 as the standard for atomic weights due to the variability in oxygen's isotopic composition.	William Giauque	United States	packing-fraction	Science: Chemistry	Aston's work with the isotopes of stable elements (see 1925) had not uncovered them all. In 1929 Giauque (see 1925) found that of every 10,000 oxygen atoms, 9,976 indeed had a mass of 16, which was the atomic weight of oxygen. This very common isotope was therefore called oxygen-16. However, of the remaining 24 atoms, 4 had a mass of 17 and 20 mass of 18. These were called oxygen-17 and oxygen-18. This was upsetting news, since oxygen atoms had been used for a century as the standard against which atomic weights could be determined. If oxygen was a mixture of isotopes, with the mixture varying a bit (perhaps) from place to place and from time to time, it wouldn't serve as a standard. There were suggestions that oxygen-16 be used as a standard, even though that meant that all atomic weights would have to be slightly altered. Eventually, the commonest isotope of carbon, carbon-12, was accepted as standard, since this would entail less change in the value of atomic weights generally.		
deoxyribose	1929	Deoxyribose	Deoxyribose, the sugar component of DNA, was identified, distinguishing it from ribose in RNA. This discovery clarified the two forms of nucleic acids: RNA and DNA, crucial for genetic material.	Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene	United States	ribose	Science: Biology	Levene had identified the sugar in some molecules of nucleic acid as ribose (see 1909). There were other nucleic acids from which a sugar that was not ribose could be obtained, but it was not till 1929 that Levene could identify that other sugar. It turned out to be deoxyribose, which had a molecule just like that of ribose except for a missing oxygen atom. That meant that there were two types of nucleic acid: ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, usually abbreviated as RNA and DNA, respectively. It was DNA that was found in chromosomes.		
heme	1929	Heme	The structure of heme, the component crucial for oxygen transport in blood, was discovered. It was not composed of amino acids, and consisted of a porphyrin ring with eight side chains.	Hans Fischer	Germany	iron-and-cytochrome	Science: Chemistry	For ten years the German chemist Hans Fischer (1881–1945) had been puzzling out the structure of heme, the complex molecular group that joined with protein to form hemoglobin. It was heme that supplied blood’s color, that contained the iron atom, and that did the work of picking up oxygen at the lungs and giving it up at the cells. Heme was not composed of amino acids, as proteins were. It was a non-protein adjunct of the molecule, which consisted of a porphyrin ring, four small rings of atoms connected into a larger ring. Attached to this ring of rings were eight side chains, four of one kind, two of another, and two of still another. Once Fischer had the general structure worked out, he realized that the side chains could be arranged in any of fifteen different ways. He organized his students into groups and had them each set about synthesizing a different arrangement. Fischer then checked them all to see which arrangement had the properties of the natural substance. By 1929 he had the structure of heme worked out to the last of its seventy-five atoms, and for this he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1930.		
estrone	1929	Estrone	The discovery of estrone highlighted the differences in development between male and female bodies. These distinctions include variations in reproductive organs, larynx size, breast size, fat distribution, and hair patterns.	Edward Adelbert Doisy, Adolf Friedrich Butenandt	United States, Germany	hormones	Science: Biology	Males and females of the same species develop differently. The sex organs arise out of similar structures, but though the penis and the clitoris are homologous, they are very different in appearance and function. The male grows a larger larynx, the female larger breasts, the subcutaneous fat distribution and the hair pattern are different in the two sexes, and so on.		
intrinsic-factor	1929	Intrinsic factor	Since patients with pernicious anemia had a characteristic lack of hydrochloric acid in their gastric juice, Castle suggested that it was some component of normal gastric juice. He called it intrinsic factor, and it aids in the absorption of the vitamin preventing pernicious anemia. 	William Bosworth Castle	United States	pernicious-anemia	Science: Medicine	The American physiologist William Bosworth Castle (b. 1897) noted that although diet could prevent pernicious anemia from developing in most patients, it did not cure the few who actually developed the disease. He reasoned that, if a vitamin was involved, those who had trouble absorbing it even when it was present in the diet were the ones who came down with pernicious anemia... Castle suggested, in 1929, that it was some component of normal gastric juice that brought about the absorption of the antipernicious-anemia vitamin. He called that missing component intrinsic factor.		
electroencephalography	1929	Electroencephalography	Electroencephalography was developed to record brain waves and diagnose brain disorders. It offered a technique for the diagnosis of such serious brain disorders as tumors and epilepsy.	Hans Berger	Germany	electrocardiogram, nerve-fibers	Science: Medicine	The German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873–1941) thought the same might be done for the brain. During the 1920s he devised a system of electrodes that, when applied to the skull and connected to an oscillograph, would give a recording of the rhythmic shifting of electric potentials commonly called brain waves. In 1929 he published his results, describing alpha waves and beta waves. In this way, electroencephalography (Greek for \"the writing of brain electricity\") was developed. It offered a technique for the diagnosis of such serious brain disorders as tumors and epilepsy.		
cardiac-catheter	1929	Cardiac catheter	Forssmann inserted a catheter (a long, thin, flexible rod that was opaque to X rays) into a vein in his own elbow and pushed it along the vein until it reached the heart. The cardiac catheter eventually allowed study and diagnosis of heart conditions without surgery. 	Werner Theodor Otto Forssmann	Germany	x-rays	Science: Medicine	A German surgeon, Werner Theodor Otto Forssmann (1904–1979), was the first to work out a practical system of cardiac catheterization. He inserted a catheter (a long, thin, flexible rod that was opaque to X rays) into a vein in his own elbow and pushed it along the vein until it reached the heart. This made it possible to study the structure and function of an ailing heart and to make accurate diagnoses without the necessity of exploratory surgery. The technique was not used clinically for over a decade, but Forssmann was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1956.		
child-development	1929	Child development	Significant progress in understanding child development was made through observations and conservation tasks. These studies highlighted children's cognitive abilities.	Jean Piaget	Switzerland	psychoanalysis	Science: Psychology	By 1929 the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980) had worked out his observations on child development. By observing and asking questions, he learned much. He also developed what he called conservation tasks; he made changes in simple objects and studied whether children could tell what had		
pluto	1930	Pluto	Astronomers suspected the existence of a distant planet beyond Neptune due to observed discrepancies in Uranus's orbit. Pluto was eventually discovered by taking two pictures of the same small part of the sky on two different days, and looking for differences.	Clyde William Tombaugh	United States	neptune, asteroid-photography	Space	Neptune had been discovered by Adams and Leverrier (see 1846) because Uranus was not moving in its orbit exactly as it should, so that the gravitational field of a more distant planet was suspected. Neptune's presence reduced but did not entirely wipe out the discrepancies in Uranus's orbit, and some astronomers thought that a still more distant but fairly large planet might exist beyond Neptune. Lowell, who was so enthusiastic about Martian canals (see 1877), was also enthusiastic about this 'Planet X' and spent much of his time calculating its possible orbit and then searching for it. He died without having found it, but at Lowell Observatory, which he had founded, the search went on. The American astronomer Clyde William Tombaugh (b. 1906) continued the search methodically. His technique was to take two pictures of the same small part of the sky on two different days. Each of these would show from		
surface-temperature-of-the-moon	1930	Surface temperature of the moon	Nicholson developed heat-measuring devices to determine the Moon's surface temperature, showing drops of 200°C during periods of its eclipse by the Earth's shadow. They found that the sunlit side of the Moon reaches 117°C and the night side sinks to -169°C. This work highlighted the Moon's poor heat conduction due to its lack of atmosphere and oceans.	Seth Barnes Nicholson and Edison Pettit	United States	thermometer	Space	Nicholson, who discovered Jupiter IX (see 1914), also developed sensitive heat-measuring devices that could determine the surface temperature of an astronomical body such as the Moon from the amount of heat it delivered to the instrument. By using it he could show that the surface temperature of the Moon dropped nearly 200° C during the period of its eclipse by the Earth’s shadow. The Moon had no ocean or atmosphere to conserve and circulate heat, and its solid body was so poor a heat-conductor that the surface lost a great deal of heat before any new supply could work its way upward from the deeper layers.		
coronagraph	1930	Coronagraph	The coronagraph is a telescope with an opaque disk to block sunlight, enabling observation of the Sun's corona. By using this instrument, Lyot captured the first clear images of the corona outside an eclipse. This meant that astronomers no longer had to wait for total eclipses to study the corona and its spectrum.	Bernard-Ferdinand Lyot	France	solar-prominences	Space	In 1930 the French astronomer Bernard-Ferdinand Lyot (1897-1952) devised the coronagraph, a telescope that focused the light of the Sun on an opaque disk, cutting out all scattered light from the atmosphere and from the lens itself. Mounting a coronagraph on the Pic du Midi, a mountain in the Pyrenees in southern France, Lyot obtained the first good photographs of the corona from a location not subject to an eclipse.		
schmidt-camera	1930	Schmidt camera	The Schmidt telescope corrects for the distortion caused by large telescopes by using a corrector plate, a small glass object with a complicated shape that could be placed near the focus of a spherical mirror. These telescopes were usually used in conjunction with a photographic plate rather than an eye.	Bernhard Voldemar Schmidt	Germany	100-inch-telescope, stellar-photography	Space	One of the difficulties with the large telescopes of the twentieth century was that they could focus on such a tiny part of the sky. It was like looking at the Universe through a keyhole. Any attempt to enlarge the view resulted in inadmissable distortion. In 1930 the Estonian-born German optician Bernhard Voldemar Schmidt (1879-1935) devised a special corrector plate, a small glass object with a complicated shape that could be placed near the focus of a spherical mirror. The corrector plate bent the light waves in such a way as to eliminate distortion, so that even wide fields could be enlarged steadily. An instrument outfitted with such a mirror and corrector plate is called a Schmidt telescope, or, since it is invariably used with a photographic plate rather than an eye receiving the light, a Schmidt camera. Used in conjunction with a conventional telescope, it can locate the interesting spots, on which the keen peephole of the telescope can then be focused.		
interstellar-matter	1930	Interstellar matter	Interstellar space is not a perfect vacuum but contains thin wisps of gas and dust that dim and redden light over vast distances. This discovery corrected previous estimates of the Galaxy's size.	Robert Julius Trumpler	United States	center-of-the-galaxy	Space	Three centuries earlier, it had come to be understood that there was a vacuum between the astronomical bodies. It was all too easy then to assume that the vacuum was perfect; that there was really nothing at all once one got outside any atm- osphere that might be clinging to the immediate surface of a body. In 1930, however, the Swiss-born American astronomer Robert Julius Trumpler (1886-1956) noted that the light of the more distant globular clusters was dimmer than would be expected from their sizes. The more dis- tant the cluster, the more marked this departure from the expected brightness. What's more, the more dis- tant the cluster, the redder the light. The easiest way of explaining this was to sup- pose that space, even far from sizable bodies, was not a perfect vacuum. (In- deed, a perfect vacuum does not exist and probably cannot exist in the Uni- verse.) There are thin wisps of gas and dust throughout interstellar space, and over vast distances, there is enough of this-of dust, particularly-to dim and redden light. By taking the dimming effect of this inter- stellar matter into account, the size of the Galaxy was shown to be somewhat smaller than Shapley's too- large estimates (see 1918).		
antimatter	1930	Antimatter	Paul Dirac developed the mathematics of electron waves and predicted the existence of the positron, a particle identical to the electron but with opposite charge. This discovery played a fundamental role in the field of subatomic physics and the study of antimatter.	Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac	England	electron-diffraction	Science: Physics	The demonstration by Da- visson and Thomson that electron waves really ex- isted (see 1927) encouraged the British physicist Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902-1984) to develop the mathematics of electron waves. From the equations he derived, it seemed to him that electrons and protons (the only two subatomic particles then known) had to exist in two energy states, one positive and one negative. At first Dirac as- sumed that the electron and proton themselves rep- resented the two energy states and were fundamen- tally the same particle. That would have been a great simplification of subatomic physics, but it didn't stand up. The proton was too massive to be the opposite of the electron and, moreover, the magnetic properties of the particle had to be precisely opposite, too. Dirac then concluded that the electron must have a counterpart of exactly the same mass as itself, but of opposite electric charge. And since the electron was already negative, this counterpart had to be positive; a particle that has come to be called the positron.		
cyclotron	1930	Cyclotron	The cyclotron is a particle accelerator that uses a magnetic field to make particles travel in a spiral path, allowing them to gain higher energies. This device was capable of producing more energetic particles compared to previous straight-line accelerators.	Ernest Orlando Lawrence	United States	particle-accelerator	Science: Physics	The particle accelerator developed by Cockcroft and Walton (see 1929) forced particles to travel in a straight line, faster and faster, thus piling up more and more energy, while being pushed on ahead by a magnetic field. The difficulty with this was that in order to get really high energies, the device had to be inconveniently long. It seemed to the American physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence that, instead of pushing the particles ever onward, it might be handier to make them travel in circles, giving them a magnetic-field push each time they came around. In 1930, therefore, he built a small device in which protons were made to travel between the poles of a large magnet that deflected their paths into circles. At each turn, they received another push of electric potential. This made them travel faster and therefore in a path that, under the constant force of the magnet, curved less sharply. The path was a sort of spiral that brought them closer and closer to the rim of the instrument. By the time the charged particles finally shot out of the instrument altogether, they had accumulated high energies indeed. Lawrence called the device a cyclotron, because the particles moved in a variety of cycles. His first device was quite small, but it produced more energetic particles than a very long voltage multiplier would have.		
computer	1930	Computers	The first machine capable of solving differential equations was created, partly electronic. This marked a significant step in the development of computers.	Vannevar Bush	United States	analytical-engine, electromechanical-calculator	Design	In 1930 the American electrical engineer Vannevar Bush (1890-1974) produced the first machine capable of solving differential equations and the first one that Babbage would have recognized as fulfilling his design. However, Bush's computer was only partly electronic.		
enzyme-crystallization-confirmed	1930	Enzyme crystallization	Sumner had crystallized the obscure enzyme urease and showed that it was a protein, but his generalized findings flew in the face of more established biochemists like Willstatter. Crystallizing the enzyme pepsin confirmed it as a protein and paved the way for further crystallization of other enzymes. This breakthrough was instrumental in biochemical research.	John Howard Northrop	United States	enzyme-crystallization	Science: Biochemistry	In 1930, the American biochemist John Howard Northrop (1891-1987) managed to crystallize, not a rather off-beat enzyme such as urease, but the very well-known digestive enzyme pepsin and showed it to be a protein. That really settled the matter (especially when Northrop went on to crystallize other well-known enzymes as well). Northrop was awarded a share (along with Sumner) of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1946.		
vitamin-a-structure	1930	Vitamin A structure	The structure of Vitamin A was identified as being related to carotenoids, the most familiar of which is carotene, responsible for the orange color of carrots. This discovery advanced the understanding and synthesis of vitamins.	Paul Karrer	Switzerland	vitamins-a-and-b	Science: Chemistry	In 1930, the Swiss chemist Paul Karrer (1889-1971) showed that vitamin A was related to the carotenoids, of which the most familiar is carotene, the coloring matter of carrots. Other carotenoids are found in sweet potatoes, egg yolk, tomatoes, lobster shells, and human skin. Vitamin A rather resembled half a molecule of carotene. This was finally proved when Karrer eventually synthesized it, which led to a rash of molecular determinations and syntheses of other vitamins, and the mystery (of their structure, at least) was removed.		
freon	1930	Freon	Refrigeration and air-conditioning technology advanced with the creation of odorless, nonpoisonous refrigerants called Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). This addressed the safety concerns of using ammonia and sulfur dioxide, but their environmental impact later led to their reduced usage.	Thomas Midgley, Jr.	United States	refrigerators, fluorine	Science: Chemistry	By now, refrigerators and air-conditioners existed, and general use was made of liquids that could be evaporated and so draw heat from the surrounding environment, thus lowering the temperature, as in the method used for liquefying gases. The main trouble was that the gases used for the purpose were ammonia and sulfur dioxide, for the most part, and that these had choking odors and were actually poisonous, so that leaks in the system were bound to be uncomfortable and might be dangerous. It would be ideal if one could find a liquid that was odorless, easily evaporated, nonpoisonous, and stable. Just such a liquid was		
godels-proof	1931	Gödel's proof	Gödel's proof demonstrated that within any given system, there are statements that cannot be proved or disproved based on the system's axioms. Gödel ended the search for certainty in mathematics by showing that it did not and could not exist, just as Heisenberg had in physics.	Kurt Gödel	Austria	symbolic-logic-and-mathematics, uncertainty-principle	Math: Logic	Gödel's proof. An Austrian mathematician, Kurt Gödel (1906-1978), put a final end to such schemes in 1931 by advancing what is now called Gödel’s proof. He translated the symbols of symbolic logic into numbers in a systematic way and showed that it was always possible to construct a number that could not be arrived at from the other numbers of his system. What it amounted to was this: Gödel showed that if you began with any set of axioms, there would always be statements within the system governed by those axioms that could be neither proved nor disproved on the basis of those axioms. If the axioms were modified in such a way that the statement could be either proved or disproved, then another statement could be constructed that		
neutrino	1931	Neutrino	A proposed particle was suggested to solve the problem of beta-particle emission. This particle, named the neutrino, was theorized to be neutral and have very little or no mass. It was very difficult to detect and remained backed by no observational evidence for many decades.	Wolfgang Ernst Pauli	Austria	exclusion-principle, beta-particle-energies	Science: Physics	For over a decade, physicists had been plagued with the problem of beta-particle emission. Beta particles might be fired out of a nucleus with all the energy to be expected from the loss in mass as one nucleus broke down into another. Generally, though, they came out with less energy, and to an unpredictable degree. They sometimes emerged with very little energy, in fact, and some physicists, in despair, felt that the law of conservation of energy simply didn’t hold in connection with beta-particle emission. In 1931, however, Pauli, who had worked out the exclusion principle (see 1925), suggested an explanation that did not violate energy conservation. He suggested that, along with the electron, another particle was given off, and that the energy was divided between the electron and the other particle in a random manner. Since the electron had all the electric charge available, the other particle had to be electrically uncharged, or neutral. Since all the kinetic energy of an electron could be converted into only a tiny quantity of mass, the other particle would have little or no mass.		
deuterium	1931	Deuterium	An isotope of hydrogen-1 was theorized to exist but not yet found. Reasoning that hydrogen-2 (aka deuterium or heavy hydrogen) would be far more massive and thus less easily evaporated than hydrogen-1, Urey evaporated liquid hydrogen and confirmed its discovery through spectroscopy.	Harold Clayton Urey	United States	liquid-hydrogen, spectral-lines	Science: Chemistry	As more and more stable elements proved to be made up of mixtures of isotopes, there was considerable feeling that even the lightest and simplest of the elements, hydrogen, ought to consist of isotopes. Hydrogen has an atomic weight of very close to 1, so that if it did consist of isotopes, hydrogen-1 must be overwhelmingly the most common. Still, there might be very small quantities of hydrogen-2 present. The American chemist Harold Clayton Urey (1893–1981) tackled the problem in 1931. He reasoned that hydrogen-2, being the more massive atom, would be less easily evaporated than hydrogen-1. If, then, he slowly evaporated a large quantity of liquid hydrogen, the final bit of liquid ought to have a percentage of hydrogen-2 larger than that in the supply he began with. Now if hydrogen-2 were present, its spectral lines ought to have slightly different wavelengths than those of hydrogen-1, and the ordinary hydrogen spectrum ought to have, accompanying each spectral line, a very faint one nearby—too faint to be sure of. However, when most of the liquid hydrogen had evaporated, leaving an unusually high concentration of hydrogen-2, the hydrogen-2 lines ought to become more prominent and should be unmistakable. This turned out to be so, and Urey announced the discovery at once.		
resonance	1931	Resonance	The benzene molecule consists of a hexagonal ring which is very stable despite its alternating single and double bonds. Pauling showed that if all atoms of a molecule were in a single plane and symmetrically placed, as in the benzene ring, the bonds are neither single nor double, but something in between. This concept of resonance made chemical reactions more predictable and increased molecular stability.	Linus Carl Pauling	United States	benzene-ring, electron-bonds	Science: Chemistry	Consider the benzene molecule, for instance. It consists of six carbon atoms in a hexagonal ring, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. Such a ring must have single bonds and double bonds in alternation. Double bonds in ordinary organic compounds represent a region of activity where two hydrogen atoms can easily be added. In the case of benzene, however, the double bonds are stable and are difficult to add to. The great stability of the benzene ring was a puzzle. Some suggested that the double bonds switched endlessly, so that any given adjacent pair of atoms were connected by a single bond and a double bond in rapid alternation. Pauling showed in 1931, however, that if all the atoms of a molecule were in a single plane (as was true of benzene) and symmetrically placed (as was again true of benzene), then the electron waves would spread out over the carbon atoms generally, so that what connected the carbon atoms was neither an ordinary single bond nor an ordinary double bond but something intermediate between the two. This spreading out of the electrons (resonance) represented a very stable conformation, and any molecule increased in stability where there was an opportunity for resonance. The concept of resonance helped greatly in explaining the manner of chemical reactions and made them far more predictable. For this, and for his work on chemical structure made possible by the concept of resonance, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1954.		
androsterone	1931	Androsterone	Butenandt isolated androsterone, a hormone produced by the testicle that stimulates male development. To do this, he distilled over 17,000 of male urine, from which they got 50 milligrams (0.77 gr) of crystalline androsterone. The isolation and analysis provided insights into male sex hormones. 	Adolf Friedrich Butenandt	Germany	estrone	Science: Biology	In 1931 Butenandt obtained a small quantity of a hormone that was named androsterone (from the Greek word for 'man'). It is produced by cells of the testicle and stimulates the type of development required to produce the characteristics of the adult male. Butenandt isolated only 15 milligrams of the hormone (a two-thousandth of an ounce), but by delicate microanalytical methods, he was able to make two analyses of the compound. For his work on the sex hormones, Butenandt was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1939.		
neoprene	1931	Neoprene	Nieuwland discovered a polymer that, when polymerized and chlorine atoms added, mimics the properties of rubber. This substance, called neoprene, kept key American industries going during a rubber supply crisis.	Julius Arthur Nieuwland	United States	vulcanization-of-rubber, chlorine	Science: Chemistry	American chemist Julius Arthur Nieuwland discovered that acetylene, a compound with a molecule made up of two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms, could polymerize to form long chains of atoms. He found that if chlorine atoms were attached at the four-carbon stage, the resulting chain was like rubber. This compound was named neoprene.		
nylon	1931	Nylon	Carothers developed a synthetic fiber, named nylon, which proved to be stronger than silk. This discovery would go on to replace silk on a large scale.	Wallace Hume Carothers	United States	silk-europe	Science: Chemistry	Wallace Hume Carothers began working with compounds called diamines and dicarboxylic acids in order to form a polymer that mimicked the properties of silk. In 1931, he discovered a polymeric fiber that, when stretched, proved stronger than silk. This polymeric fiber was eventually called nylon.		
virus-particles	1931	Virus particles	By this point, forty major diseases were known to be caused by viruses but their nature remained a mystery. Elford used fine filters to determine that viruses were smaller than bacteria but larger than most molecules. This contributed significantly to understanding the size and nature of viruses.	William Joseph Elford	England	filtrable-virus	Science: Biology	English bacteriologist William Joseph Elford used fine collodion membranes graded to keep out smaller particles to determine that viruses were smaller than even the smallest bacteria, but larger than most molecules. This discovery helped in understanding the minute size of viruses.		
virus-culture	1931	Virus culture	Success in dealing with bacterial disease was enabled by the ability to grow pure colonies of bacteria in glassware and study them in detail. Goodpasture developed an analogous technique to culture viruses in eggs which contain living cells. This technique enabled closer virus study and vaccine development, particularly for diseases like poliomyelitis.	Ernest William Goodpasture	United States	filtrable-virus, bacteriology	Science: Biology	American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture devised a technique to culture viruses in eggs, which contain living cells. This method made it possible to study viruses and develop vaccines for diseases, such as poliomyelitis.		
stratospheric-balloons	1931	Stratospheric balloons	Humans had reached heights up to 6 miles before, and uncrewed balloons were used to reach greater heights. Piccard built a sealed aluminum gondola with a normal atmosphere and ascended to 10 miles to study the ionosphere and cosmic rays more intimately.	Auguste Piccard	Switzerland	stratosphere, cosmic-rays	Science: Physics	Human beings had reached heights of up to 6 miles in balloons but had done so at great peril, for the air is not dense enough at such heights to be thoroughly capable of supporting life (see 1902). Uncrewed balloons were used to reach greater heights. This was not satisfactory to the Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard (1884-1962), who wanted to study the ionosphere and cosmic rays more intimately than the instruments of the day made possible. What had to be done, he felt, was to construct a sealed aluminum gondola within which a normal atmosphere could be maintained however high the balloon climbed. In 1931, making use of such a sealed gondola, Piccard ascended to a height of nearly 10 miles, half again as high as human beings had ever risen before. This paved the way for other and even higher penetrations of the stratosphere by himself and others. Eventually, heights of nearly 20 miles were achieved.		
neutron	1932	Neutron	The neutron was discovered as a particle with the mass of a proton and no charge, proving crucial for nuclear reactions. For example, beryllium emitted a strange radiation which Chadwick theorized were uncharged, neutral particles that were part of the atom. These "neutrons" were difficult to detect because all of the subatomic particle detection instruments were based on electric charge.	James Chadwick	England	particle-spin, proton	Science: Physics	For twenty years, it had been assumed that the atomic nucleus was made up of protons and electrons, since these were the only two subatomic particles known. Thus the nitrogen nucleus had a mass of 14, so it must contain fourteen protons. On the other hand, the nitrogen nucleus had an electric charge of +7, whereas fourteen protons would have an electric charge of +14. Therefore, the nucleus must have seven electrons with a charge of -1 each to neutralize the charge of seven of those protons. The net result was that the nitrogen nucleus was thought to be made up of 14 protons and 7 electrons, or 21 particles altogether. But seven years earlier, when Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit worked out the con		
proton-neutron-nucleus	1932	Proton-neutron nucleus	Heisenberg suggested that these recently discovered neutrons must live inside the nucleus. This neatly explained anomalies in nuclear spins and the existence of isotopes. A hydrogen-1 atom contained just a proton and an electron, while a hydrogen-2 atom also contained a neutron. However why a nucleus packed with positively charged protons could be stable remained a mystery.	Werner Karl Heisenberg	Germany	isotopes, neutron	Science: Physics	In 1930 Bothe, who had devised the coincidence counter (see 1929), became aware of strange radiations emerging from beryllium that had been exposed to bombardment with alpha particles, but he couldn't tell what the radiation consisted of. In 1932, however, the English physicist James Chadwick (1891-1974) repeated the experiments and maintained that the best way of explaining the observations was to suppose that the alpha particles knocked neutral particles out of the beryllium nucleus. These particles could not be detected directly, since they lacked an electric charge, but they succeeded in knocking protons out of the atomic nuclei in paraffin, and those protons could be detected. A radiation capable of ejecting protons must consist of particles with a mass in the proton range, and a particle possessing the mass of a proton and no charge was just the thing to represent a proton-electron pair and yet be one particle and not two. The new particle was called a neutron, and it proved to be by far the most useful particle for initiating nuclear reactions. For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1935.		
positron	1932	Positron	An anti-electron had been theoretically predicted by Dirac but none had yet been observed. Anderson studied cosmic rays using a cloud chamber but devised a lead partition to slow these particles down. Some of these slowed particles behaved like electrons but deflected in the opposite direction, indicating a positive charge.	Carl David Anderson	United States	antimatter, cloud-chamber, cosmic-rays	Science: Physics	Dirac had predicted, from theoretical considerations, that there must be a particle just like the electron but with a positive charge rather than a negative one (see 1930). However, such an antielectron had not been observed in nature. The American physicist Carl David Anderson (b. 1905) was working with Millikan (see 1911) on cosmic rays. To carry out his studies, he had devised a cloud chamber (see 1911) with a lead partition running across it. A cosmic ray particle entering an ordinary cloud chamber was so energetic that a magnetic field scarcely managed to deflect it at all, and from the virtually straight-line trace that resulted, not much information about it could be derived. If a lead partition was placed in the chamber, the cosmic ray particle had energy enough to smash through it but lost enough energy in the process to allow it to be easily deflected on the far side of the partition. In 1932, while conducting research with his lead-partitioned cloud chambers, Anderson noted tracks emerging from the lead that were clearly electron tracks (experienced researchers could read tracks at a glance). The only peculiarity was that the electron tracks curved in the wrong direction. Anderson had found the positively charged particle that Dirac had predicted—the antielectron. Anderson, however, thought of it as a positive electron and gave it the shortened name of positron, which it has carried ever since. For his discovery, Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1936, sharing it with Hess, who had discovered cosmic rays (see 1911).		
particle-accelerator-and-nuclear-reaction	1932	Particle accelerator and nuclear reaction	Protons accelerated by a particle accelerator were fired at lithium nuclei, resulting in the production of alpha particles and a creating a nuclear reaction. This was the first nuclear reaction produced by humans using artificially accelerated particles.	Cockcroft and Walton	England	nuclear-reaction, particle-accelerator	Science: Physics	The first human-made nuclear reaction had been carried through by Rutherford (see 1919). For the purpose, he had used alpha particles produced naturally by radioactive sources. Other nuclear reactions brought about since then had also made use of such alpha particles. In 1932, however, Cockcroft and Walton, still working under Rutherford, found a way of accelerating protons, using electrical fields, to energies high enough so that when they reached a lithium nucleus they brought about a nuclear reaction—changing the lithium to helium.		
radio-waves-from-space	1932	Radio waves from space	A new kind of weak static, originating from the constellation of Sagittarius (the center of the galaxy), was detected and identified as radio waves from space, leading to the birth of radio astronomy. This marked a shift in astronomy from light waves to interpreting radio waves, although development was initially hindered by a lack of precise instruments.	Karl Guthe Jansky	United States	center-of-the-galaxy, ionosphere	Space	As radio came more prominently into use for communication and home entertainment, the problem of static (a crackling interference that made communication uncertain and music unpleasant) cried out for correction. Static had a number of causes, including thunderstorms, nearby electric equipment, and aircraft passing overhead. The Bell Telephone Company, which needed radio for ship-to-shore calls, among other things, set one of its employees, Karl Guthe Jansky (1905-1950), to exploring the problem. Jansky detected a new kind of weak static from a source that at first he could not identify. It came from overhead and moved steadily. At first it seemed to Jansky that it must be the Sun. However, the source gained slightly on the Sun to the extent of 4 minutes a day. This is just the amount by which the vault of the stars gains on the Sun, so that the source must lie beyond the Solar System. By the spring of 1932, Jansky had decided that the source was in the constellation of Sagittarius, the direction in which Shapley had placed the center of our galaxy (see 1918). This represented the birth of radio astronomy, in which astronomers learned to receive and interpret radio waves rather than light waves. Light waves, of course, are easily perceived by the retina of the eye and by photographic film. In 1932, however, perceiving radio waves with any precision was extremely difficult, for instruments were lacking. Therefore, the development of radio astronomy was delayed for some twenty years.		
electron-microscope	1932	Electron microscope	Electron waves, having wavelengths similar to X rays but easier to focus, were utilized to create the electron microscope, allowing much smaller objects to be observed compared to traditional microscopes. This innovation marked a significant advancement in microscopy through the use of magnetic fields to focus electron waves.	Ernst August Friedrich Ruska	Germany	electron-diffraction, microscope, dewar-flask	Science: Physics	Davisson had demonstrated that electrons did indeed have their wave aspects (see 1927). Therefore they might be manipulated in much the same way that light waves were. They might be focused as light waves were in microscopes, for instance. The sharpness with which tiny objects can be seen varies inversely with the wavelength of the viewing medium. The shorter the wavelength, the smaller the objects that can be made out. Since electron waves have a wavelength equal to that of X rays (but are much easier to focus than X rays), an electron microscope should be much more powerful than an ordinary optical microscope. Electron waves cannot be focused by passing them through lenses, of course, but they can be focused by appropriate magnetic fields. The German electrical engineer Ernst August Friedrich Ruska (1906-		
prontosil	1932	Prontosil	Prontosil was effective against streptococcus infections and led to the development of many antibacterial drugs. Domagk tested his discovery on his own young daughter, who had been infected following a needle prick. When other treatments failed, he injected a large quantities of Prontosil and she recovered. This represented a significant advance in chemotherapy.	Gerhard Domagk	Germany	chemotherapy	Science: Biology	The German biochemist Gerhard Domagk (1895-1964) conducted systematic tests of new dyes synthesized since the time of Ehrlich to see if he could find something appropriate. One of them was a newly synthesized orange-red compound with the trade name Prontosil. In 1932 Domagk found that injections of the dye had a powerful curative effect on streptococcus infection in mice. As it happened, Domagk's young daughter, Hildegard, had been infected by streptococci following the prick of a needle. When other treatment failed, Domagk injected large quantities of Prontosil. She recovered, and the world had another item in its chemotherapeutic armory. Prontosil was the forerunner of a large number of drugs that would cause many infectious diseases to lose their terrors.		
ascorbic-acid	1932	Ascorbic acid	The structure of vitamin C was determined and named ascorbic acid (after the Greek for "no scurvy"). This six-carbon molecule was also determined to be identical to hexuronic acid.	Charles Glen King	United States	hexuronic-acid	Science: Chemistry	In 1932 the American biochemist Charles Glen King (1896-1988) concluded his investigations of vitamin C, in the course of which he had isolated the vitamin and determined its structure. The substance had a six-carbon molecule closely resembling those of the sugars and was named ascorbic acid, from Greek words meaning 'no scurvy.'		
urea-cycle	1932	Urea cycle	The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion. This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered, and provided key insights into nitrogen metabolism in mammals.	Hans Adolf Krebs	England	synthetic-urea, digestion	Science: Biology	As biochemists learned more and more about metabolism, it became clear that certain reactions fit into the pattern of a chain. Often the chain moved from its starting point back to that same point after a number of steps (forming a cycle), achieving some result with each turn of that cycle. Thus the German-born British biochemist Hans Adolf Krebs (1900-1981) showed that when the amino acid arginine broke down and was reconstituted, it produced in the process a molecule of urea (so that it was called the urea cycle). Urea is the chief nitrogen-containing waste in mammals generally.		
polaroid	1932	Polaroid	This invention aligns organic crystals and embeds them in clear plastic. Polaroid replaced Iceland spar in scientific instruments that relied on polarized light and was also used in automobile windshields and spectacles.	Edwin Herbert Land	United States	nicol-prism	Science: Optics	Nicol had made use of Iceland spar to produce an instrument that could be used in the study of polarized light (see 1829). Some substitute for Iceland spar that would be cheaper and easier to work with would have been welcome, but none was known.To be sure, there were certain organic crystals that behaved as Iceland spar did, but they did not readily produce crystals of the proper size, and the crystals would have been far too fragile to work with in any case. An American inventor, Edwin Herbert Land (b. 1909), had the idea that a single crystal was not necessary. A myriad of tiny crystals would do if all were oriented in the same direction. In 1932 he devised methods of aligning the crystals and of then embedding them in clear plastic. When set, this served nicely to keep them from drifting out of alignment and made their fragility irrelevant. The result was given the trade name Polaroid, and it quickly replaced Iceland spar in scientific instruments. It also came to be used in automobile windshields and in spectacles.		
quinacrine	1932	Quinacrine	A satisfactory substitute for quinine, called quinacrine or Atabrin, was developed as a successful antimalarial. This discovery ensured a reliable treatment for malaria, especially important when quinine supplies were disrupted during wartime.	Fritz Mietzsch	Germany	quinine	Science: Medicine	Malaria, a widespread disease in the tropics and perhaps the most debilitating disease, on the whole, that was suffered by the human species, had been treated with quinine for three centuries (see 1642). Quinine comes from the bark of a tropical tree, however, and the supply to the industrial nations might easily be cut off in wartime. The search was on for a substitute. The first satisfactory substitute to be found was quinacrine (also called Atabrin), first developed in Germany and established as a successful antimalarial in 1932. When not too many years afterward, war did indeed disrupt the quinine supply, the existence of quinacrine made it possible for troops to operate in tropical regions.		
synthetic-vitamin-c	1933	Synthetic vitamin C	Vitamin C was synthesized in the laboratory, making it possible to produce the vitamin in large quantities. This breakthrough led to the creation and popularity of vitamin pills, helping to solve nutritional deficiencies.	Tadeus Reichstein	Switzerland	ascorbic-acid, organic-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	In 1933 the Polish-born Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin. Eventually, other vitamins were analyzed and then synthesized. This meant that it was no longer necessary to obtain small quantities of vitamins from huge quantities of foodstuff. Instead, they could be synthesized in the laboratory by the pound and even by the ton. Nor were the synthetic vitamins in any way different from the natural ones. The ability to synthesize vitamins led to the development and popularity of vitamin pills, and when these became available at affordable prices, the nutritional problem of vitamins in the diet was diminished or even abolished.		
molecular-beams	1933	Molecular beams	Molecular beams can be created by making a tiny hole in a mostly vacuum. The resulting streams of particles forms tight beams, behaving like tiny magnets. This discovery supported quantum mechanics and demonstrated wave aspects in molecular beams.	Otto Stern	United States	maxwells-equations, electron-diffraction	Science: Physics	If gases are allowed to escape from a container through a tiny hole into a high vacuum, the escaping molecules meet virtually no molecules with which they can collide. They therefore form a tight beam of moving particles. These molecular beams are made up of particles that are neutral but that are themselves made up of charged particles: nuclei and electrons. As a result, in accordance with Maxwell’s equations, they ought to behave like tiny magnets. The German-born American physicist Otto Stern studied these molecular beams for years and by 1933 had conclusively demonstrated that they did behave like magnets and in ways, moreover, that also supported quantum mechanics. Furthermore, Stern showed that the molecular beams possessed wave aspects.		
approach-to-absolute-zero	1933	Approach to absolute zero	A method for approaching absolute zero using magnetic techniques was successfully turned into practice. Using magnetic fields and gadolinium sulfate, the temperature 0.0185 °K was attained.	William Giauque	United States	magnetism-and-absolute-zero	Science: Physics	In 1933 Giauque managed to turn theory into practice. He imposed a magnetic field on gadolinium sulfate, then let it retreat into disorder on the removal of the field. The retreat into disorder required heat and absorbed it from the surrounding helium. In this way, he lowered its temperature to 0.25 degrees above absolute zero. By the end of a year, others using the same technique had reached 0.0185° K.		
neutron-bombardment	1934	Neutron bombardment	Neutron bombardment involves using neutrons to convert elements into others by changing their atomic number through beta particle emission. Attempts to synthesize element 93 led to confusing results which were not understood for the next five years.	Enrico Fermi	Italy	neutron	Science: Physics	As soon as Chadwick had discovered the neutron (see 1932), it was clear that it would be an extremely useful tool for the bombardment of nuclei. Protons and alpha particles, being positively charged, are repelled by the positively charged nuclei, and much of their energy must be expanded in overcoming this repulsion. Neutrons, being uncharged, can drift into a nucleus even when low in energy. When a neutron is absorbed by the nucleus of a particular atom, the new nucleus may be unstable and may emit a beta particle, which by subtracting a negative charge converts a neutron in the nucleus into a proton. The net result is that the nucleus ends up with one proton more than it started with, which makes it an element that is one higher in atomic number.In 1934 it occurred to Fermi (see 1926 and 1931) that it would be particularly interesting to bombard uranium atoms with neutrons and perhaps form atoms with an atomic number of 93, which are not known in nature.  The results of the bombardment turned out to be confusing, and the conclusion was not straightened out for five years—but then with portentous results. For his work on neutron bombardment generally, Fermi was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1938.		
weak-interaction	1934	Weak interaction	To provide a theoretical foundation for the recently observed neutrinos, Fermi suggested a new force of attraction between particles so close together that it only applied inside the nucleus. He showed that there was an interaction involved in connection with neutrinos that was like an electromagnetic interaction but much weaker. Despite being stronger than gravity, it was called "weak interaction".	Enrico Fermi	Italy	neutrino	Science: Physics			
artificial-radioactivity	1934	Artificial radioactivity	Artificial radioactivity involved bombarding aluminum atoms with alpha particles to produce radioactive phosphorus-30 and silicon-30. This discovery demonstrated that stable elements could be converted into radioactive isotopes, known as radioisotopes. 	Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie	France	nuclear-reaction, neutron-bombardment	Science: Physics	In 1934 French physicists Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie bombarded aluminum atoms with alpha particles, converting aluminum into phosphorus-30 by adding neutrons to the nucleus. They also produced silicon-30 through the release of protons. Silicon-30 is naturally occurring, while phosphorus-30 is radioactive and does not occur in nature.		
cherenkov-radiation	1934	Cherenkov radiation	The speed of light varies depending on the medium it is traveling in. Cherenkov radiation is emitted when particles move faster than the maximum light speed through a non-vacuum, leaving a wake of light trailing behind. This radiation helps determine the speed of ultrafast particles.	Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov	Russia	special-relativity	Science: Physics	Light travels at a speed of 299,792.5 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second), and nothing can go faster than that according to special relativity (see 1905). However, light travels more slowly when passing through matter, and the decrease in speed is more marked as the index of refraction of the transparent medium increases. In water, light travels at 224,900 kilometers per second, and only 124,000 kilometers per second in diamond. The speed of light is even a bit below maximum when it is passing through air. A rapidly moving particle can never travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, but it can travel faster than light does in water, let us say. And if the particle is moving extremely close to the speed of light in a vacuum, it may move faster in air than light does. When particles move faster than light in some medium other than a vacuum, they leave a wake of light trailing behind.		
supernovas	1934	Supernovas	Zwicky suggested novas seen by Tycho, Kepler, and in the Andromeda galaxy were supernovas, incredibly luminous star explosions viewable across galaxies. Supernovas can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy and can be spotted over immense distances.	Fritz Zwicky	Switzerland	supernova, novas-in-andromeda	Space	Tycho Brahe had observed a very bright nova (see 1572) and so had Kepler in 1604. Since then, three and a quarter centuries had passed without such a bright nova being seen. To be sure, from time to time new stars had been seen that were fairly bright and that qualified as novas, but none had attained a brightness surpassing that of Jupiter, or even Venus, as the novas of Tycho and Kepler had. In 1885 a nova had appeared in the Andromeda nebula that had attained a brightness of magnitude 7, almost bright enough to see with the unaided eye, but this had not been made much of at the time. When Hubble, however, showed that the Andromeda nebula was really a far distant galaxy (see 1923), the brightness of the 1885 nova had to be reassessed. To be nearly visible to the unaided eye from the vast distance of the Andromeda galaxy, it had to be enormously more luminous than the run-of-the-mill novas that had been seen since Kepler's time. The Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky (1898-1974) pointed this out in 1934 and suggested that novas such as those Tycho and Kepler had seen and the one in the Andromeda galaxy were supernovas. Since Kepler's time, none had been seen in our own galaxy, but Zwicky, watching other galaxies, spotted a number. Since a supernova shines at its peak with a brilliance about equal to the total light of an average galaxy, a supernova can be seen as far as a galaxy can.		
neutron-stars-hypothesis	1934	Neutron Stars	After expending its energy, a supernova might collapse under its own gravitational pull till its protons and electrons were crushed together to form neutrons and the neutrons were forced into contact. Such a neutron star might possess all the mass of a full-sized star and be only 8 miles across. These would be difficult to detect and were not observed for decades.	Fritz Zwicky	Switzerland	supernovas, white-dwarfs	Space			
sex-hormones	1934	Sex hormones	Leopold Stenhphan Ruzicka synthesized androsterone confirming Butenandt's analysis. Later, Butenandt also isolated progesterone, a female sex hormone crucial to the mechanisms involved in pregnancy.	Adolf Butenandt and Leopold Stenhphan Ruzicka	Germany, Switzerland	androsterone	Science: Biology	Butenandt had isolated the male sex hormone androsterone and worked out its structure (see 1931). In 1934 the Croatian-born Swiss chemist Leopold Stenhphan RuÅ¾iÄeka (1887-1976) synthesized androsterone and showed that Butenand's analysis was correct. For this he shared the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1939 with Butenandt. Meanwhile, also in 1934, Butenandt isolated progesterone, a female sex hormone of vital importance to the chemical mechanisms involved in pregnancy. Butenandt, like Domagk (see 1932, Prontosil), could not accept the Nobel Prize because of Hitler's ruling. It was not until 1949 that he could accept it formally.		
bathysphere	1934	Bathyspheres	The bathysphere, a sealed gondola capable of maintaining interior pressure at great ocean depths, was devised to overcome the limitations of previous diving equipment. Designed as a sphere with quartz windows, Beebe descended about a kilometer underwater in this vessel.	Charles William Beebe	United States	stratospheric-balloons	Science: Marine Biology	Since earliest time, people had dived beneath the ocean surface, either for pleasure or to gather such objects as sponges and pearl oysters. Naturally they could not go very deep or stay very long. Later they could stay underwater for extended periods in caissons or diving suits, but only at the cost of having the air they breathed compressed to the pressure of the surrounding water. This limited the depth to which they could penetrate and the time they could remain. At high pressures, nitrogen dissolves in the blood and bubbles out when the pressure is relieved, causing the bends, or caisson disease, which results in agonizing pain and sometimes paralysis and death. To prevent this, pressure has to be released very slowly, a procedure first suggested in 1878 by the French physiologist Paul Bert (1833-1886). To achieve real depth for indefinite periods, it was clearly necessary to provide a sealed gondola capable of maintaining an interior at ordinary pressures, as Piccard had done (see 1931). The task was more difficult at sea, for in the heights the difference between inside and outside pressure was less than one atmosphere, while in the depths the sea pressed in with many atmospheres of pressure. The American naturalist Charles William Beebe (1877-1962) devised the necessary steel vessel. It had thick quartz windows and was a sphere (at the suggestion of President Roosevelt) rather than a cylinder for greater strength. In 1934 Beebe used this bathysphere (Greek for "sphere of the deep") to descend to a record depth of 3,028 feet, nearly three-fifths of a mile. It was terribly risky, for he had to be suspended from a ship, and if the lifeline had snapped, no rescue was possible. However, no untoward incidents took place during his explorations.		
uranium-two-three-five	1935	Uranium-235	By now almost all stable isotopes had been discovered. One exception was uranium, which was found to consist of two isotopes in its natural state: uranium-238 and uranium-235 at a ratio of 140:1.	Arthur Jeffrey Dempster	United States	isotopes, mass-spectrometer	Science: Physics	Since the concept of isotopes had been advanced by Soddy (see 1913), almost all the stable isotopes had been discovered, thanks to the work of Aston and his mass spectrograph (see 1919 and 1925). Nevertheless, it was not till 1935 that uranium was found to consist of two isotopes in its natural state. The common form had a nucleus made up of 92 protons and 146 neutrons, so that it was uranium-238. In 1935 the Canadian-born American physicist Arthur Jeffrey Dempster (1886-1950) showed that there was also another isotope, making up only 1 out of 140 uranium atoms, that had a nucleus containing 92 protons and 143 neutrons, so that it was uranium-235. There was no way of telling at the time of its discovery how enormously important uranium-235 was, but the demonstration came within a few years.		
isotopic-tracers	1935	Isotopic tracers	Radioactive atoms were first used as tracers in biochemical work, but inorganic elements such as lead interfered with biological processes. The use of stable isotopes like carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-18, and hydrogen-2 became significant for biochemical analysis due to their distinguishable mass differences.	Rudolf Schoenheimer	Germany	radioactive-tracers, isotopes	Science: Chemistry	Hevesy had first used radioactive atoms as tracers in biochemical work (see 1918). However, he had used radioactive lead, and lead is not a natural component of tissue, so that its presence might well have interrupted the natural flow of chemical reactions there. Since then, however, it had been found that elements that were not radioactive were also made up of isotopes. In particular, the four most common and important elements of tissue each existed also as an isotope that was relatively rare, quite stable, and capable of being differentiated from the common isotope. Thus there was carbon-13, which was 8.5 percent more massive than the common carbon-12; nitrogen-15, 7.1 percent more massive than the common nitrogen-14; oxygen-18, 12.5 percent more massive than the common oxygen-16; and hydrogen-2, 100 percent more massive than the common hydrogen-1. The greater the percentage difference in mass, the easier it was to analyze.		
crystalline-viruses	1935	Crystalline viruses	Stanley used enzyme crystallization techniques to better understand viruses . Crystallized viruses retained infective properties, proving viruses can be crystalline, a form of matter characteristic of nonliving molecules. This blurred the line between living and non-living matter, showing viruses' simplicity.	Wendell Meredith Stanley	United States	enzyme-crystallization-confirmed, virus-culture	Science: Biology	The first enzyme had been crystallized by Sumner (see 1926), and other enzymes had been crystallized since by Northrup and others (see 1930), so that the mystery of the chemical nature of enzymes was removed. In 1935 he obtained fine needlelike crystals, which he isolated and found to possess all the infective properties of the virus in high concentration. This raised problems, since it had always been thought that crystals were a form of matter characteristic of nonliving atoms and molecules, and since viruses could multiply, they had been thought to be living. The answer, quickly arrived at, was that crystallization was not a dividing line between life and nonlife, and that viruses were so simple a life form that they could crystallize.		
strong-interaction	1935	Strong Interaction	Yukawa deduced there had to be a short-range force like that of the weak interaction, one that could be felt only within the nucleus. This force would have to be much stronger than the weak interaction and indeed much stronger than the electromagnetic interaction in order to overcome proton repulsion, hence "strong".	Hideki Yukawa	Japan	proton-neutron-nucleus, weak-interaction	Science: Physics			
sulfanilamide	1935	Sulfanilamide	Protonsil had certain antibacterial properties but a very complicated structure. Sulfanilamide is a breakdown product of protonsil with some of the same desirable properties. It led to the development of sulfa drugs used to combat various infections.	Gerhard Domagk	Germany	prontosil	Science: Chemistry	Domagk had found that the dye Prontosil had certain antibacterial properties (see 1932). Prontosil had a fairly complicated molecule, however, and there was a reasonable hope that some smaller fraction of that molecule might have the same desirable properties but be easier to synthesize and so more available in quantity. In 1935 Domagk managed to break up the molecule of Prontosil into several fragments, one of which was sulfanilamide, a compound already well known to organic chemists. Sulfanilamide turned out to have very pronounced antibacterial properties. This heralded the synthesis of a whole family of similar compounds, collectively called the sulfa drugs, which were used to combat infections of various kinds.		
riboflavin	1935	Riboflavin	Scientists had found multiple water-soluble vitamins similar to the vitamin B that cured beriberi. The one that cured beriberi came to be known B-1, and it and its cousins were named the B-complex. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B-2, was synthesized and its structure confirmed.	Paul Karrer	Switzerland	dietary-deficiency-diseases, organic-synthesis, vitamin-a-structure	Science: Biology	Since the work of Eijkman on beriberi (see 1896), biochemists had discovered a number of vitamins that, like the vitamin B that cured beriberi, were water-soluble and contained rings made up of carbon and nitrogen molecules. They came to be labeled vitamin B-1 (which cured beriberi), vitamin B-2, and so on. The whole was the B-vitamin complex. These letter-number combinations turned out to be unsatisfactory, however, because some reported vitamins turned out to be false alarms and others were simply not given such combination names. The B vitamins therefore came to be known by chemical names. Thus vitamin B-1 came to be called thiamin, vitamin B-2 riboflavin, and so on. Karrer, who had determined the structure of vitamin A (see 1930), synthesized riboflavin in 1935 and presented the final proof of its structure. For this work, he was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1937.		
corticoids	1935	Corticoids	The adrenal glands consist of two parts: the inner part (medulla) creates epinephrine but the outer part (cortex) also creates a variety of hormones. Kendall identified 28 which he named after letters. These corticoids, particularly Compound E (cortisone), were discovered and used as anti-inflammatory drugs. 	Edward Calvin Kendall	United States	epinephrine, hormones	Science: Biology	The American biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall (1886–1972) isolated no fewer than twenty-eight different cortical hormones, or corticoids, of which four showed effects on laboratory animals. He named the corticoids by letter, and the four effective ones were Compound A, Compound B, Compound E, and Compound F. Of these, Compound E, which Kendall isolated in 1935, proved the most useful. It came to be called cortisone and was widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug. For his work on corticoids, Kendall was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1950.		
prostaglandins	1935	Prostaglandins	Prostaglandins are hormonelike substances isolated from semen and found to have various physiological effects. This discovery broadened the understanding of hormone functions in the body.	Ulf Svante Von Euler	Sweden	androsterone	Science: Biology	In 1935 the Swedish physiologist Ulf Svante Von Euler (1905–1983) isolated a hormonelike substance from semen, which he took to represent a product of the prostate acting as a gland. He therefore called it prostaglandin. Prostaglandin and related compounds referred to collectively as the prostaglandins have since been found in other tissues and have proved to have a wide variety of physiologic effects on the body.		
radar	1935	Radar	Radio detection and ranging, abbreviated to ra. d. a. r, was developed to follow the path of airplanes by detecting electromagnetic reflections. Microwaves are the best to use for this purpose because they are reflected by moderately sizable objects and are sufficiently penetrating to pass through cloud and fog.	Robert Alexander Watson-Watt 	Scotland	spectral-line-shift, sonar	Science: Physics	To send out a beam of light and record the time it took to be reflected back across a given distance had first been used to determine the speed of light by Fizeau (see 1849). Once the speed of light was determined with good accuracy, the time it took for a beam of light to strike an object and return could be made to yield both the direction and the distance of the reflecting object. Such a scheme, making use of ultrasonic sound, had been used by Langevin in devising sonar (see 1917). The use of light for such a purpose is impractical.		
imprinting	1935	Imprinting	Imprinting is a behavior in which young birds follow a moving object shortly after hatching, hopefully their mother. In their mother's absence, the hatchlings would follow some other adult bird or a human being or even a pulled inanimate object. This discovery led to the establishment of the science of ethology, studying animal behavior in natural environments.	Konrad Lorenz	Germany	conditioned-response	Science: Biology	In 1935 the Austrian-born German zoologist Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989), a student of bird behavior, described imprinting. He showed that at a certain critical point in early life, soon after hatching, young birds learned to follow a moving object, usually their mother, who was sure to be in the neighborhood after all. If this for some reason was not the case, the hatchlings would follow some other adult bird or a human being or even a pulled inanimate object. Once imprinting had taken place, it affected their behavior to some extent all their lives. Lorenz thus established the science of ethology, the study of animal behavior in natural environments, and initiated the study of how learned behavior in very early life affected later events. For his work on animal behavior, he was awarded a share in the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1973.		
richter-scale	1935	Richter scale	The Richter scale measures earthquake intensity using a numerical scale where each increment represents a tenfold increase in movement. It is essential for assessing the impact and potential damage of earthquakes. The strongest earthquakes so far recorded have reached 8.9 on the Richter scale. 	Charles Francis Richter	United States	earthquakes	Science: Geology	In 1935 the American geophysicist Charles Francis Richter (1900-1985) established the Richter scale for the measurement of earthquake intensity. This scale measured the extent of Earth movement by a series of numbers, each one of which represented a movement ten times as great as the number before. The damage done rises even faster than the extent of movement. The strongest earthquakes so far recorded have reached 8.9 on the Richter scale.		
neutron-absorption	1936	Neutron absorption	Wigner worked out the mathematics of neutron absorption into atomic nuclei, showing that the likelihood of neutron absorption varied with 1) the energy of the neutron and 2) the size of the cross section of the receiving nucleus.	Eugene Paul Wigner	United States	neutron, weak-interaction	Science: Physics	After Chadwick's discovery of the neutron (see 1932), the use of neutron bombardment to induce nuclear reactions had achieved considerable importance, especially in the work of Fermi (see 1934). In 1936 the Hungarian-born American physicist Eugene Paul Wigner (b. 1902) worked out the mathematics that governed the manner in which neutrons were absorbed by atomic nuclei. It showed how the likelihood of neutron absorption varied with the energy of the neutron. It also introduced the concept of nuclear cross section: the greater the cross section of a particular type of nucleus, the greater the likelihood of its absorbing a neutron. For this and other work, Wigner was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1963.		
thiamine	1936	Thiamine	The molecular structure of thiamine (Vitamin B-1) was determined and synthesized. This advance made it possible to produce thiamine in large quantities without relying on rice polishings.	Robert Runnels Williams	United States	riboflavin	Science: Biology	Thiamine (also known as vitamin B-1) is the name given to the vitamin that prevents beriberi, and whose existence had come to be suspected as a result of Eijkman's work (see 1896). The American chemist Robert Runnels Williams (1886-1965) brought this work to fruition. He had isolated about a third of an ounce of the vitamin from a ton of rice polishings, and this was enough to enable him to determine its molecular structure. In 1936 he synthesized thiamine—the final proof that his structure was correct. It was then no longer necessary to work with huge quantities of rice polishings. Thiamine by the ton could be prepared in the laboratory.		
perfusion-pump	1936	Perfusion pump	An improved perfusion pump that could keep organs or tissues alive for extended periods was developed. This device, called an artificial heart, enhanced the process of perfusion by being more efficient and germ-proof. As proof, he kept piece of embryonic chicken heart alive and growing for over thirty-four years, much longer than the normal life expectancy of a chicken.	Alexis Carrel	France	tissue-culture	Science: Medicine	Carrel (see 1902) was much in the news in the 1930s through his demonstrations that it was possible to keep organs or tissues alive by means of perfusion; that is, by passing blood or blood substitutes continuously through the tissues by way of its own blood vessels. He kept a piece of embryonic chicken heart alive and growing (it had to be periodically trimmed) for over thirty-four years—much longer than the normal life expectancy of a chicken—before the experiment was deliberately terminated. In 1936, to make the process more efficient, Carrel put into use a perfusion pump that Lindbergh (see 1927) had helped him design. It drove the blood and was germ-proof. It was called an artificial heart, though it was not the kind of artificial heart that could substitute for the natural one in the human chest.		
technetium	1937	Technetium	Element 43 was one of the remaining gaps in the periodic table. Technetium was briefly produced by bombarding molybdenum not with neutrons, but with deuterons because these charged particles could be greatly accelerated in a cyclotron. It is the simplest element with no stable isotopes to have been formed in the laboratory.	Emilio Gino Segrè	Italy	deuterium, rhenium, cyclotron	Science: Chemistry	Technetium By now, only four gaps remained in the periodic table of elements between number 1 (hydrogen) and number 92 (uranium). They were numbers 43, 61, 85, and 87. Noddack and his colleagues, who had discovered rhenium (see 1925), thought they had also discovered number 43, but it turned out they were mistaken. The Italian physicist Emilio Gino Segrè (1905–1989) tackled the problem in a different way. Thinking the chances small that he could find the element in the Earth’s crust, he wondered if he might not manufacture it. After all, Fermi had been bombarding elements with neutrons to produce elements higher by one atomic number (see 1934). If Segrè bombarded molybdenum (element 42), might he not then manufacture detectable quantities of element 43? In 1937 Segré bombarded molybdenum with deuterons, the atomic nuclei of hydrogen-2, which had been discovered by Urey (see 1931, Deuterium). A deuteron consists of one proton and one neutron, rather loosely bound. If such a particle approached a nucleus, the positive charge of the nucleus would repel the positively charged proton, breaking it from the neutron and deflecting it away. The uncharged neutron, unaffected, would strike the nucleus. It was an American physicist, Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967), who had demonstrated that deuteron bombardment was equivalent to neutron bombardment. Why not use neutrons in the first place? Because the deuteron, carrying an electric charge, could be accelerated in a cyclotron and made very energetic. A neutron by itself could not. Segré analyzed the bombarded molybdenum and did indeed isolate very small quantities of an element that, from its chemical properties, could be seen to be number 43. It was the first element to be indisputably formed in the laboratory, rather than discovered in nature, so it was named technetium, from the Greek word for “artificial.” As it turned out, no technetium isotope was stable; all were radioactive. It is, indeed, the simplest element to have no stable isotopes. The most nearly stable isotope, technetium-97, has a half-life of 2,600,000 years. That is not a long enough half-life for it to have endured in the soil since the formation of the Earth. It is for that reason that it was never detected in the soil, and why Noddack had to be mistaken.		
muon	1937	Muon	The muon was discovered while studying cosmic ray bombardment and identified as a particle more massive than an electron but less than a proton. It was theorized to sit between the proton and neutron to help resolve the mysterious strong force. When it was later found that this "meson" had no interaction with atomic nuclei, it was renamed muon to avoid confusion.	Carl David Anderson	United States	positron, strong-interaction	Science: Physics	Anderson, who had discovered the positron as a result of studying cosmic ray bombardment of atoms within Earth’s atmosphere (see 1932), was still investigating such bombardments. In the process, he discovered the track of a particle that, from its curvature in the magnetic field, appeared to be more massive than an electron but less massive than a proton. By 1937 there was no doubt about it, for the same phenomenon had been observed by others as well. It seemed to be the type of particle that Yukawa had postulated (see 1935, Strong Interaction), when trying to work out what held protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. The new particle was called a mesotron, from a Greek word for “intermediate,” and this was eventually shortened to meson. Once it was found that there were different varieties of these intermediate particles, different mesons had to be identified and differentiated in some way. Anderson’s meson was therefore called a mu-meson, mu being a Greek letter equivalent to our m. It turned out, however, that the mu-meson was not the particle Yukawa had postulated. It showed no tendency to interact with nuclei, and Yukawa’s particles would have had to. Its name was therefore contracted further to muon, since it was not a meson in the sense that other intermediate-sized particles were.		
electrophoresis	1937	Electrophoresis	Electrophoresis is a technique for separating and isolating protein components in a mixture. Imposing an electric field on the solution, negative and positive particles will begin to separate at speeds proportional to their overall charge. Then, using a specially designed tube, lenses, and photography, subcomponent speed can be measured by observing changes in light refraction. 	Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tiselius	Sweden	dry-plates, protein-size, cathode-rays	Science: Biology	A Swedish biochemist, Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tiselius (1902-1971), developed the technique in 1937. He devised a special tube in the form of a rectangular U within which the proteins could move and separate. The Tiselius tube consisted of portions fitted together at specially ground joints, which could be separated to isolate one of a mixture of proteins in a particular chamber.In addition, by the use of proper cylindrical lenses, it was possible to follow the process of separation by observing changes in the refraction of light passing through the suspension. These changes could be photographed, and the resulting wavelike pattern could be used to calculate the quantity of each protein present in the mixture. Failure to separate a mixture into components by electrophoresis was good evidence of the purity of a protein preparation, particularly if there continued to be no separation when the acidity of the solution was changed.		
electron-microscope-improved	1937	Improved electron microscope	Electron microscopes were improved to greatly outperform optical microscopes, the best of which peaked at a magnification of 2000x. Hillier's initial improvements led to 7000x and eventually magnifications of two million times.	James Hillier	Canada	electron-microscope	Science: Physics	The first electron microscope had been constructed by Ruska (see 1932). It was not till 1937, however, that an electron microscope was constructed that could clearly outperform the best optical microscopes. The Canadian physicist James Hillier (b. 1915) accomplished this feat. His microscope could magnify seven thousand times, whereas the best optical microscope could only manage a magnification of two thousand times.		
field-emission-microscope	1937	Field-emission microscope	The field-emission microscope employs a fine needle tip in a high vacuum to emit electrons, creating highly magnified images on a fluorescent screen. It made possible the visualization of single atoms.	Erwin Wilhelm-Mueller	United States	electron-microscope	Science: Physics	A magnifying device even more impressive than the electron microscope, although of only limited use, is the field-emission microscope, first devised in 1937 by the German-born American physicist Erwin Wilhelm-Mueller (1911-1977).		
radio-telescope	1937	Radio telescope	The first radio telescope was housed in the inventor's backyard and used a 31 foot wide parabolic reflector to concentrate radio waves from space onto a radiometer. Reber discovered points in the sky that emitted radiation more strongly than background, and was the first to prepare a radio map of the sky.	Grote Reber	United States	radio-waves-from-space, cosmic-rays	Space	Radio waves from outer space had been detected by Jansky (see 1932), but nothing had been done about it because the devices necessary for detecting and analyzing the radiation were not yet in existence.In 1937, however, an American radio engineer, Grote Reber (b. 1911), built the first radio telescope in his back yard. It was a parabolic reflector that concentrated the incoming radio waves on a nearby radiometer, which then measured the solar and cosmic radio reception.		
virus-nucleic-acid	1937	Virus nucleic acid	It was discovered that tobacco mosaic virus contained RNA in addition to protein. Later it was discovered that viruses generally contain either RNA or DNA, meaning that they are structurally close to chromosomes.	Frederick Charles Bawden	England	crystalline-viruses	Science: Biology	Stanley had succeeded in crystallizing tobacco mosaic virus and proving that it was protein in nature (see 1935). The question was whether the virus was entirely protein. Viruses are indisputably living, and if they consisted only of protein, it would follow that protein molecules (if sufficiently complex) were the essence of life. Everything else, even simpler proteins, would be merely auxiliary material. In 1937, however, a British plant pathologist, Frederick Charles Bawden (b. 1908), was able to show that tobacco mosaic virus contained, in addition to protein, a small quantity of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Eventually, viruses generally were found to contain either RNA or DNA, which means they are nucleoprotein rather than merely protein. The fact that chromosomes are also nucleoproteins (containing DNA) makes it seem that viruses are chromosomes 'on the loose' and that it is nucleoprotein that is the essence of life.		
citric-acid-cycle	1937	Citric acid cycle	The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, details a multi-step process where sugar molecules are converted into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the process. This cycle is crucial for cellular respiration and energy production in organisms.	Hans Adolf Krebs	England	coenzyme, enzyme-crystallization, cytochrome, urea-cycle	Science: Biology	Many biochemists had contributed insights concerning the metabolism of carbohydrate, including Harden (see 1904), Meyerhof (see 1913), and Warburg (see 1926). Szent-Györgyi (see 1928, Hexuronic Acid) had found that any of four different four-carbon acids, if added to tissue slices, stimulated oxygen uptake. He suspected that they must play some role in carbohydrate metabolism. Beginning in 1937, the German-born British biochemist Hans Adolf Krebs (1900–1981) found two six-carbon acids, including the familiar citric acid, that also played a role. He worked out the details of a cycle that began and ended with citric acid. Sugar molecules entered the cycle, and carbon dioxide molecules emerged at the other end, along with several pairs of hydrogen atoms that, through another chain of reactions including cytochromes (see 1924), were united with oxygen to yield the energy used by the body. This citric acid cycle is often called the Krebs cycle in honor of its discoverer, and for this work, Krebs was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1953.		
niacin	1937	Niacin	Nicotinic acid or niacin could cure pellagra by being converted to nicotinamide in the body. This discovery highlighted the importance of niacin as a member of the vitamin B family in preventing vitamin-deficiency diseases. It turned out that other vitamins also worked because they were essential parts of coenzymes that could not be manufactured in the body.	Conrad Arnold Elvehjem	United States	pellagra, coenzyme-structure	Science: Biology	Goldberger had shown that pellagra was a vitamin-deficiency disease (see 1915). A disease of dogs called blacktongue was the canine equivalent of pellagra. In 1937 the American biochemist Conrad Arnold Elvehjem (1901–1962) considered the problem. Euler-Chelpin had shown that Harden’s coenzyme included nicotinamide (see 1923). The enzyme wouldn’t work without the coenzyme, and the coenzyme wouldn’t work without the nicotinamide portion. Human beings, therefore, stricken with pellagra, must be suffering from a deficiency of that portion of the coenzyme. Elvehjem then showed that nicotinic acid (niacin) (see 1875) was identical with the active portion of the coenzyme, that the acid could be converted to nicotinamide by the body and that it would cure pellagra by addition to the diet. Today, niacin is known to be a member of the vitamin B family.		
yellow-fever-vaccine	1937	Yellow fever vaccine	Jenner was the first to develop a vaccine for smallpox, and Pasteur added other vaccines against such diseases as cholera, anthrax, and rabies. Now a safe and effective yellow fever vaccine was developed, significantly reducing fear of the disease. 	Max Theiler	United States	vaccination, anthrax-inoculation	Science: Biology	A vaccine that conferred immunity to one or another serious disease was first used by Jenner in connection with smallpox (see 1796). Pasteur had added other vaccines against such diseases as cholera, anthrax, and rabies (see 1881). The South African-born American microbiologist Max Theiler (1899-1972) developed a vaccine against yellow fever. By 1937, the vaccine was quite safe and effective, which did much to remove the dread of this terrible disease. For this, Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1951.		
evolution-and-mutation	1937	Evolution and mutation	A pivotal book called "Genetics and the Origin of Species" linked mutation and evolution, enhancing the understanding of evolution on both molecular and organismic levels. 	Theodosius Dobzhansky	United States	evolution-by-natural-selection, genetics, mutations	Science: Biology	Darwin had advanced the theory of evolution by natural selection a century before (see 1858). He assumed that selection took place because in every generation there were small variations among the offspring of a particular species. How those variations arose, he didn't know. Soon after Darwin, Mendel had developed the laws of genetics (see 1865), and some decades later, De Vries had shown the existence of mutations (see 1900). It seemed possible that mutations provided the variations that allowed natural selection to function as a mechanism for producing evolutionary changes. The exact rationale of this was not quite understood, however. In 1937 the Russian-born American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975), who worked with fruit flies after the fashion of Morgan (see 1927), published a book entitled ‘Genetics and the Origin of Species’ in which mutation and evolution were neatly joined together. As a result, evolution was understood on a molecular level as well as on an organismic level.		
solar-energy-source	1938	Solar energy source	Gamow suggested that hydrogen fusion was the source of the Sun's energy but could not supply the details. Almost a decade hence, much had been learned about nuclear reactions. Bethe used this knowledge and estimates of pressures and temperatures deep in the Sun's core to explain the mechanism by which hydrogen fusion could take place in the Sun's core.	Hans Albrecht Bethe	United States	solar-energy	Science: Physics	Gamow had suggested that hydrogen fusion was the source of the Sun’s energy (see 1929) but could not supply the details. By 1938, however, much had been learned about nuclear reactions—the energy they delivered and the speed with which they took place—from experiments in the laboratory. This, together with reasonable estimates of the pressures and temperatures deep in the Sun’s core, enabled the German-born American physicist Hans Albrecht Bethe (b. 1906) to outline in detail the mechanism by which hydrogen fusion could take place in the Sun’s core. (The German astronomer Carl Friedrich Weizsacker [b. 1912] independently advanced similar ideas at about the same time.) For the first time, a suitable answer was given to Helmholtz’s question about the source of the Sun’s energy (see 1853). For this, and for other work in nuclear physics, Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1967.		
magnetic-resonance	1938	Magnetic resonance	A technique of magnetic resonance was developed from earlier work on molecular beams. This allowed to measure the energies absorbed and given off by particles in the beam in an extremely accurate manner.	Isidor Isaac Rabi	United States	molecular-beams	Science: Physics	The Austrian-born American physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi (1898–1988) continued the work of Stern on molecular beams (see 1933). Rabi, in 1938, developed the technique of magnetic resonance whereby it		
vitamin-e-synthesis	1938	Vitamin e synthesis	Vitamin E was synthesized, and its structure was established. This added to the understanding of vitamins and their chemical compositions.	Paul Karrer	Switzerland	vitamin-a-structure, riboflavin	Science: Chemistry	Vitamin structure was rapidly being worked out in full detail. Karrer, who had synthesized vitamin A (see 1930) and riboflavin (see 1935), synthesized vitamin E in 1938 and thus established its structure.		
phase-contrast-microscope	1938	Phase-contrast microscope	When it is diffracted, light slightly alters its phase so that different objects in a cell appear to take on color even though they are colorless ordinarily. Making use of such diffraction allows objects within the cell to be made out clearly and easily without killing the cell by adding a dye. A microscope using this techniques was constructed. 	Frits Zernike	Netherlands	electron-diffraction	Science: Physics	In 1938 the Dutch physicist Frits Zernike (1888–1966) constructed a microscope based on a phenomenon he had been investigating for years. When it is diffracted, light slightly alters its phase so that different objects in a cell appear to take on color even though they are colorless ordinarily. Making use of such diffraction allows objects within the cell to be made out clearly and easily without killing the cell by adding a dye. For this phase-contrast microscope, Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1953.		
iconoscope	1938	Iconoscope	If an electron beam could be made to pass over every part of a screen as the result of a varying magnetic field, and if the screen could be made to fluoresce appropriately, the electron beam could paint a picture. Such a practical television set called the iconoscope was constructed.	Vladimir Kosma Zworykin	United States	cathode-rays, oscilloscope	Science: Engineering	The existence of the cathode ray tube (see 1876) had raised a new possibility. If an electron beam could be made to pass over every part of a screen as the result of an appropriately varying magnetic field, and if the screen could be made to fluoresce appropriately, the electron beam could paint a picture, so to speak. The result would be what was eventually called a television screen. The first practical television camera was constructed in 1938 by the Russian-born American engineer Vladimir Kosma Zworykin (1889–1982). He called it an iconoscope. The rear of the iconoscope was coated with a large number of tiny cesium-silver droplets. Each emitted electrons as a light beam scanned it, in proportion to the brightness of the light. The electrons in the television tube were controlled by the electrons in the iconoscope, so that the screen showed the same scene that entered the iconoscope. Eventually, with improvements, the iconoscope made television a practical reality.		
xerography	1938	Xerography	Aware of the constant need for copies of patent specifications, a lawyer and physicist strove to invent a way of copying paper. He devised a method using electrostatic forces to attract carbon black to paper was devised, and because nothing moist is needed, he dubbed it xerography (Greek for "dry writing").	Chester Floyd Carlson	United States	dry-plates, cadmium-lithium-selenium	Science: Physics	In 1938 the American physicist and lawyer Chester Floyd Carlson (1906–1968), aware of the constant need for copies of patent specifications, labored to devise some new way of providing them. The means he found involved attracting carbon black to paper by localized electrostatic forces. This technique he called xerography (from Greek words meaning 'dry writing,' since no ink was used), and his first successful attempt came on October 22, 1938. It took years to secure a patent and interest a corporation in the process. Eventually, though, the process led to the modern technique of photocopying, which has virtually eliminated the mimeograph machine and greatly reduced the need for carbon paper.		
ballpoint-pen	1938	Ballpoint pen	A ballpoint pen design was developed utilizing a rolling ball to transfer high-viscosity ink. This ink would not blot, streak, or stain the fingers and dried almost at once. Fountain pens and inkwells became almost obsolete, and even pencils and erasers became less prominent.	Ladislao and Georg Biro	Hungary	fountain-pen	Design	In 1938 two Hungarian brothers, Ladislao Biro and Georg Biro, designed a ballpoint pen: ink from an internal reservoir coated a tiny ball at the end of the pen, and the ball rolled, depositing ink on the paper. When the design was sufficiently improved and a high-viscosity ink was developed, the ballpoint pen spread rapidly across the world and became a regularly used writing instrument.		
coelacanth	1938	Coelacanth	The Coelacanth, a fish previously believed to be extinct for seventy million years, was discovered alive off South Africa in 1938. This primitive fish's survival offered significant insights into evolutionary biology, particularly as a close relative of early land vertebrates.	J. L. B. Smith	South Africa	evolution-and-mutation	Science: Biology	Finding a new kind of fossil is exciting enough, but finding a living specimen of a species thought to exist only as a fossil is far more exciting. On December 25, 1938, a trawler fishing off South Africa brought up an odd fish about 5 feet long. The oddest thing about it was that its fins were attached to fleshy lobes rather than directly to the body. A South African zoologist, J. L. B. Smith, who had the chance of examining it, recognized it as a coelacanth, a primitive fish that zoologists thought had been extinct for seventy million years—to have vanished from the Earth while dinosaurs still existed. Eventually, other specimens of the fish were obtained as well. What is most interesting about this (from our own viewpoint) is that the coelacanth is a close relative of the kind of fish that, hundreds of millions of years ago, clambered onto land, became amphibious, and thus became our ancestors.		
nuclear-fission	1939	Nuclear fission	Researchers bombarded uranium (element 92) with slow neutrons to explore the emission of two alpha particles and possible formation of a radium isotope (element 88). Instead they found barium (element 56) which puzzled scientists. This process was eventually confirmed and called fission.	Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner	Germany and Austria	protactinium, neutron-bombardment	Science: Physics	Fermi had bombarded uranium with slow neutrons in the hope of obtaining element number 93, but the results had been confusing (see 1934). Hahn and Meitner, who had discovered protactinium (see 1917), were investigating the matter. Among other things, they dissolved the bombarded uranium and added a barium compound. When they precipitated the barium, they found that a fraction of the radioactivity came down with it. This was what they had hoped for. Barium is chemically very like radium, so that anything that precipitated barium would also precipitate radium. In fact, the bombardment of uranium (element number 92) with neutrons might somehow result in the emission by uranium of two alpha particles, which would reduce the atomic number by four and so produce an isotope of radium (element number 88). Then, since barium is similar to radium but not identical, the two could be separated, and the idea of double alpha-particle emission would be proved. (That was the idea behind adding the barium in the first place.) However, although the barium did precipitate radioactivity, the radioactivity simply could not be separated from it. The problem was therefore more puzzling than ever.		
nuclear-chain-reaction	1939	Nuclear chain reaction	Analogous to a chemical chain reaction, the concept of a nuclear chain reaction was described where one neutron would disrupt a nucleus and produce two neutrons, which would disrupt two nuclei, producing four neutrons, etc. This concept paved the way for nuclear reactors and atomic bombs.	Leo Szilard	Hungary	energy-of-activation, neutron-bombardment	Science: Physics	Chain reactions are familiar in chemistry. In 1932, the Hungarian-born physicist Leo Szilard envisaged a nuclear chain reaction as a series of neutron disruptions producing energy exponentially. Each disruption releases a tiny quantity of energy; a nuclear bomb would have enormous power compared to chemical chain reactions.		
francium	1939	Francium	Francium, named for the discoverer's native country was detected as a result of the breakdown of an isotope of element number 87. The most stable isotope of the element is francium-223, which has a half-life of only 22 minutes.	Marguerite Perey	France	isotopes	Science: Chemistry	Only three elements remained undiscovered: numbers 61, 85, and 87. In 1939 the French physicist Marguerite Perey (1909-1975), working with the radioactive element actinium, discovered a type of beta activity that was not quite like that of any known isotope. She tracked it down and found that it resulted from the breakdown of an isotope of element number 87. She named it francium, for her native country. As it turned out, the most nearly stable isotope of the element is francium-223, which has a half-life of only 22 minutes. Of all the elements between 1 and 92, francium is the only one that possesses no isotope with a half-life of as much as half an hour.		
neutron-stars-theory	1939	Neutron stars	Neutron stars' existence was theoretically analyzed, although none had been observed by that time. This work remained theoretical for thirty more years.	J. Robert Oppenheimer	United States	neutron-stars-hypothesis, nuclear-chain-reaction	Space	Zwicky had suggested the possible existence of a neutron star (see 1934). In 1939 Oppenheimer (see 1937) analyzed the possibilities mathematically, in the light of what was known of nuclear reactions. Nevertheless, the matter remained strictly theoretical, for no such object had actually been observed, or would be for another thirty years.		
magnetic-moments	1939	Magnetic moments	Felix Bloch calculated the magnetic moment of the neutron, a particle thought to have no magnetic field. This suggested it might be a particle made up of more fundamental particles that did have electrical charges. His work also implied the possible existence of an anti-neutron.	Felix Bloch	United States	magnetic-resonance	Science: Physics	The magnetic properties of atoms and molecules had been determined by the studies of molecular beams undertaken by Stern (see 1933) and by Rabi (see 1938). The Swiss-born American physicist Felix Bloch (1905-1983) worked out methods for determining the magnetic properties of molecules within liquids and solids. From this work, he calculated the magnetic moment of the neutron. This was important, because the neutron is not an electrically charged particle and should therefore have no magnetic field. Yet Bloch demonstrated that it had. This was the first indication that the neutron might be a composite particle, made up of more fundamental particles that did have electrical charges. The fact that the neutron had a magnetic moment, incidentally, showed that such a thing as an anti-neutron could exist, which would have a magnetic field pointed in the direction opposite to that of the neutron. The magnetic moment of the neutron was independently worked out at about the same time in another way by the American physicist Edward Mills Purcell (b. 1912). As a result, Bloch and Purcell shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1952.		
vitamin-k	1939	Vitamin K	Vitamin K was discovered as a fat-soluble vitamin essential for blood coagulation after observing hemorrhages in hens on certain diets. Dam named it K for koagulation, the German spelling of the word. Doisy worked out the structure of the vitamin and synthesized it.	Carl Peter Henrik Dam and Edward Adelbert Doisy	Denmark and United States	synthetic-vitamin-c	Science: Biology	A Danish biochemist, Carl Peter Henrik Dam (1895-1976), fed hens a synthetic diet and noticed that on some diets they developed small hemorrhages under the skin and within the muscles. Vitamin C, which cures some conditions like that, didn’t help. He finally decided that the problem stemmed from lack of some fat-soluble vitamin not yet known, the presence of which was necessary for proper coagulation of the blood. He named it vitamin K (for koagulation, the German spelling of the word). This was done in 1934, but it was not till 1939 that the American biochemist Edward Adelbert Doisy (1893 – 1986) worked out the structure of the vitamin and synthesized it. For this work, Dam and Doisy shared the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1943.		
rh-factor	1939	Rh factor	The Rh factor was identified as a crucial component in preventing erythroblastosis fetalis in newborns, where it was missing in Rh-negative mothers with Rh-positive fetuses. Named after Rhesus monkeys used as experimental animals, its discovery allowed for routine testing and better management of blood transfusions.	Philip Levine	United States	blood-types	Science: Biology	After the A, B, and O blood factors were discovered by Landsteiner (see 1900), other blood factors were discovered that did not interfere with transfusion and did not involve health problems (see 1927). A Russian-born American immunologist, Philip Levine (b. 1900), was studying erythroblastosis fetalis, a disease of fetuses and newborn infants that was marked by severe destruction of the red blood cells. (They were therefore called blue babies.) Levine noted, in 1939, that the mothers in these cases lacked a blood component called the Rh factor (because it had first been recognized in the blood of rhesus monkeys used as experimental animals). The mothers were Rh-negative, but the fathers were Rh-positive, which was genetically dominant, so that their offspring were Rh-positive also. However, the fetus’s blood apparently brought about the production of antibodies to the Rh-positive factor in the mother’s blood. These antibodies filtered into the fetus’s blood and destroyed the red corpuscles. Routine testing for Rh factor prepared physicians for this possibility, and the replacement of the infant’s blood supply by new blood reduced the death rate.		
penicillin-practical	1939	Practical Penicillin	The antibacterial agent in penicillin was successfully isolated, paving the way for its widespread use during wartime and beyond. This groundbreaking work earned its pioneers a Nobel Prize.	Howard Walter Florey, Ernst Boris Chain	England	penicillin	Science: Medicine	Fleming had discovered penicillin (see 1928), but nothing much came of it until 1939. Then an Australian-born British pathologist, Howard Walter Florey (1898-1968), in collaboration with a German-born British pathologist, Ernst Boris Chain (1906 – 1979), set about isolating the actual antibacterial agent from the mold. They reached their goal quickly and the groundwork was laid for penicillin’s use during the dark days of war that were to follow. As a result, Florey, Chain, and Fleming were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1945.		
tyrothricin	1939	Tyrothricin	By now it was known that pathogenic bacteria do not fare well in the soil, which is why burial is an effective way of preventing the spread of disease. Tyrothricin, an antibacterial substance, was isolated from soil bacteria.	René Jules Dubos	United States	bacteriophages	Science: Biology	Most pathogenic bacteria do not survive well in the soil, which is why burying people who have died of disease does not necessarily keep epidemics going. It is possible to reason that this may be because antibacterial substances are produced by bacteria that do commonly live in the soil and are not pathogenic. (One might suppose that there is an evolutionary benefit for these bacteria in preventing the invasion of other species of bacteria.) The French-born American microbiologist René Jules Dubos (1901–1982) investigated the matter and, in 1939, isolated an antibacterial substance from a bacillus that lived in the soil and named it tyrothricin.		
essential-minerals	1939	Essential minerals	Keilin showed that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase contained a small quantity of zinc that was essential to its working. This meant that since the enzyme was essential to life, so was zinc. Other minerals associated with enzymes turned out to be required too, like manganese, molybdenum, and copper.	David Keilin	England	iron-and-cytochrome, dietary-deficiency-diseases	Science: Biology			
ddt	1939	DDT	DDT is an organic compound discovered to be effective against insects, contributing to the fight against insect-borne diseases and crop protection. It represented a turn in pesticide development, although later identified to have harmful effects.	Paul Hermann Müller	Switzerland	mosquitoes-and-malaria, bacteriophages	Science: Chemistry	The most serious enemies of humanity, next to pathogenic microorganisms, are the insects. Not only do they carry and spread diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, typhus, and encephalitis, but they also eat crops and make serious inroads into the human food supply. Through the ages, they have been feared and fought, and as knowledge of chemistry grew, poisons had been used to kill them. Unfortunately, the inorganic poisons used, such as Paris green, were deadly to mammals, including human beings. The Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller (1899-1965) began a search for organic substances that might be poisonous to insects but not to other forms of life, and that would also be cheap, stable, and without unpleasant odor. In September 1939 he tried dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (of which the common abbreviation is DDT), a compound known to chemists since 1873, and it seemed to fulfill all the requirements. DDT proved exceedingly valuable in the years to come, particularly in fighting lice-spread typhus, so that Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1948. In time, to be sure, DDT turned out to have its harmful aspects after all, and its use dwindled. Nevertheless, it was the forerunner of a great variety of pesticides that have served humanity.		
helicopter	1939	Helicopter	A helicopter is an aircraft that achieves lift through a large overhead propeller, allowing it to lift off vertically without requiring forward motion. The first successful helicopter flight was achieved in 1939, marking a breakthrough in aviation.	Igor Ivan Sikorsky	United States	airplane	Design: Aviation	One problem with airplanes is that they must move quickly in order to produce aerodynamic lift under their wings. If they slow up, the lift dwindles and they crash. A device that exerted a force straight upward instead of merely forward as propellers do would eliminate this necessity for speed-born lift. The obvious solution was a large propeller directly overhead. Since the ends of the propeller would mark out a helix as the vehicle lifted upward, such a device was called a helicopter, from Greek words meaning "helical wing." The Russian-born American aeronautical engineer Igor Ivan Sikorsky (1889-1972) had been working with helicopters for thirty years and finally in 1939 produced a satisfactory model. On September 14, a helicopter with Sikorsky himself at the controls flew successfully.		
frequency-modulation	1939	Frequency modulation	Frequency modulation (FM) was devised as a method of reducing static interference in radio transmissions by altering the frequency of the carrier signal instead of its amplitude. It allowed for clearer reception, but was limited in range.	Edwin Howard Armstrong	United States	superheterodyne-receiver	Science: Radio	Static in radio broadcasts was proving a rather intractable problem. Radio transmission for the first forty years after Marconi's discovery (see 1901) was carried out by systematically altering the amplitude (the height of the wave) of the carrier signal to match the variation in the amplitude of the sound waves being transmitted. This was called amplitude modulation, or AM. Unfortunately, thunderstorms and electrical appliances also modulate the amplitude, doing it randomly and producing the irritating noise of static. In 1939, however, Armstrong, who had invented the superheterodyne receiver (see 1916), devised a method of transmitting a signal by systematically altering the frequency (the length of the wave) of the carrier signal. This was called frequency modulation, or FM. Thunderstorms and electrical appliances have no effect on frequency, so FM transmission is largely static-free. Unfortunately, FM will work only for carrier waves of high frequency, and these cannot be transmitted much beyond the horizon.		
neptunium-and-plutonium	1940	Neptunium and plutonium	New elements neptunium (number 93) and plutonium (number 94) were discovered by American physicists by studying bombarded uranium. These were the first transuranium elements discovered, hence their names.	Edwin Mattison McMillan and Philip Hauge Abelson	United States	nuclear-fission	Science: Chemistry	In 1940 the American physicists Edwin Mattison McMillan (b. 1907) and Philip Hauge Abelson (b. 1913), studying uranium that had been bombarded with neutrons, detected a beta particle with a half-life of 2.3 days. When they had tracked this down, they announced on June 8, 1940, that they had located traces of element number 93. Since uranium had been named for the planet Uranus (see 1789), the new element, lying beyond uranium, was named neptunium, for Neptune, the planet lying beyond Uranus.		
uranium-hexafluoride	1940	Uranium hexafluoride	To produce enriched uranium for nuclear bombs, uranium hexafluoride, which can be easily evaporated, was separated through the gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride. This allowed the isolation of uranium-235 from uranium-238, facilitating the creation of enriched uranium.	Philip Hauge Abelson	United States	gas-laws, uranium-two-three-five	Science: Chemistry	One of the problems in preparing an nuclear bomb was that only uranium-235 would participate in a slow-neutron nuclear chain reaction, but uranium-238 was present to the extent of 140 atoms for every atom of uranium-235. The uranium-238 atoms would absorb neutrons and undergo reactions other than fission, which dampened and even aborted the chain reaction. It would be necessary to prepare enriched uranium, with a larger percentage of the uranium-235 atoms. Separating two isotopes is difficult, however, if uranium were a gas, which could be made to pass through long narrow passages, or very fine holes, the uranium-235, being lighter by 1.26 percent, would move a little faster, so that the first sample to arrive at the other end would be slightly richer in uranium-235 than the natural element would be. If this was done over and over (gaseous diffusion), satisfactorily enriched uranium would result. But uranium is not a gas. In 1940 Abelson, who was helping to isolate neptunium (see above), suggested that uranium hexafluoride, with each molecule made up of one uranium atom and six fluorine atoms, was a liquid that was easily evaporated, and the vapors might then be made to pass through tubes or holes. Uranium hexafluoride containing a uranium-235 atom had a molecular weight of 349 compared to 352 for uranium hexafluoride with a uranium-238 atom. The difference in weight is nearly 1 percent, and that was enough. Gaseous diffusion sufficed to produce enriched uranium.		
astatine	1940	Astatine	Astatine, an unstable element of atomic number 85, was discovered by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles. Its discovery filled the second last gap in the periodic table, with only element 61 remaining.	Emilio Gino Segrè	Italy	technetium	Science: Chemistry	In 1940 Segrè, who had isolated technetium (see 1937), bombarded bismuth with alpha particles. If an alpha particle struck the bismuth and remained, or even if a neutron were emitted there after, the bismuth would have gained two protons and the result would be the undiscovered element number 85. This was accomplished in 1940, but World War II interrupted, and it wasn’t until the war was over that they could confirm their finding. The new element was quite unstable. Its most long-lived isotope had a half-life of only 83.3 hours. It was therefore named astatine, from the Greek word for “unstable.” It belonged to the same group as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, which is why it received the -ine ending. With the discovery of astatine, only one gap remained in the entire period table.		
betatron	1940	Betatron	The betatron is an accelerator that whirls electrons in circles instead of spirals, effectively accelerating beta particles without incurring mass increases that would cause the accelerating pulse to go out of sync. This innovation made useful electron bombardment possible.	Donald William Kerst	United States	cyclotron, special-relativity	Science: Physics	Cyclotrons were used to accelerate protons, which are massive particles and energetic enough to get results even when they are not moving at very high speeds (see 1930). It might be useful to accelerate electrons, but they are so light that to obtain useful energies they would have to be brought to speeds quite close to that of light. That would introduce a mass increase according to special relativity (see 1905) and cause the accelerating pulse to go out of synchronization, setting a too-low limit on the speeds achieved. In 1940, however, the American physicist Donald William Kerst (b. 1911) devised an accelerator that whirled the electrons in circles rather than spirals. This new device, called the betatron (because it accelerated beta particles), made useful electron bombardment possible.		
streptomycin	1940	Streptomycin	Streptomycin is an antibiotic discovered in fungi from the Streptomyces family, effective against bacteria not affected by penicillin but more toxic to humans. Waksman introduced the term "antibiotic".	Selman Abraham Waksman	United States	tyrothricin, penicillin	Science: Biology	Dubos’s discovery of tyrothricin (see 1939) had galvanized one of his past teachers, the Russian-born American microbiologist Selman Abraham Waksman (1888–1973). Using Dubos’s methods, Waksman began to search for bacteriocidal compounds in microscopic fungi. In 1940 he located one he called actinomycin because it was found in fungi of the Actinomyces family. Not long after, he found one in fungi of the Streptomyces family and called it streptomycin. Streptomycin was quite effective against bacteria that were not affected by penicillin but was considerably more toxic to human beings than penicillin and had to be used very cautiously. It was Waksman who coined the term antibiotic (from Greek words meaning “against [micropscopic] life”), and for his work on them, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1952.		
color-television	1940	Color television	Color television methods began development with early systems using rotating three-color disks, but these were not commercially adopted. More effective color transmission methods were introduced later, making television in full color possible for the public.	Peter Carl Goldmark	United States	iconoscope	Design	Although television existed as a laboratory exercise only and wouldn’t enter the American home till after World War II, methods were already being developed to transmit television in full color. The first to work out such a system was the Hungarian-born American engineer Peter Carl Goldmark (1906–1977), who used a rotating three-color disk for the purpose in 1940. The method was not, in the end, used. More effective methods were finally made commercial some fourteen years later.		
high-energy-phosphate	1941	High-energy phosphate	Phosphate esters were known to be critical to the body's function. This discovery found two kinds of phosphate bonds, one liberating a small quantity of energy and the other a large quantity, called high-energy phosphate. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a key compound with high-energy phosphate bonds, crucial for bodily energy functions.	Fritz Albert Lipmann	United States	metabolic-intermediate, citric-acid-cycle	Science: Biology	Fritz Albert Lipmann (1899-1986) showed that there were two kinds of phosphate bonds. In one kind, the loss of the phosphate bond liberated a relatively small quantity of energy; in the other, the loss liberated a relatively large quantity. The latter esters possessed a high-energy phosphate. In the course of carbohydrate metabolism, phosphate groups are added to sugar molecules forming a low-energy phosphate. The sugar molecule then undergoes the kind of change that concentrates the energy in the phosphate group, so that a high-energy phosphate is formed. These high-energy phosphate groups then serve as the "small change" of energy. In the simplest terms, food and oxygen combine to form high-energy phosphate bonds, which then deal out energy for all the energy-consuming functions of the body. The most versatile of the high-energy configurations is a compound called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), each molecule of which contains two high-energy phosphates and which has been found to be concerned with body chemistry at almost every point where energy is required.		
polarimetry	1941	Polarimetry	A Polarimeter involves a small drop of mercury repeatedly falling through a solution to a mercury pool beneath. An electric current flows through the solution and, as the potential was increased, the current reached a plateau the height of which depended on the concentration of certain ions in the solution. This technique helps to analyze unknown solutions.	Jaroslav Heyrovský	Czech Republic	mercury-thermometer, electrical-conductance	Science: Chemistry	The Czechoslovakian physical chemist Jaroslav Heyrovský (1890-1967) had worked for years on a device that contained a mercury electrode so arranged that a small drop of mercury repeatedly fell through a solution to a mercury pool beneath. An electric current flowed through the solution and, as the potential was increased, the current reached a plateau, the height of which depended on the concentration of certain ions in the solution. In this way, one could analyze a solution of unknown composition. By 1941 Heyrovský had perfected this technique, which he called polarimetry, and for this work, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1959.		
cardiac-catheterization-practice	1941	Cardiac catheterization practice	After Forssmann's bold demonstration in 1929, this practice of inserting a catheter into a vein and guiding it to the heart, was introduced in medical practice. This advancement significantly impacted medical practice and was later awarded a Nobel Prize.	André Frédéric Cournand and Dickinson Woodruff Richards	United States	cardiac-catheter	Science: Medicine	Forssmann had introduced the principle of cardiac catheterization (inserting a catheter into a vein and maneuvering it to the heart—see 1929). In 1941 it was introduced into clinical practice by the French-born American physiologist André Frédéric Cournand (1895-1988) and the American physician Dickinson Woodruff Richards (1895-1973). As a result, Cournand and Richards were awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1956, sharing it with Forssmann.		
distance-of-the-sun-eros	1941	Distance of the Sun revised	Using the parallax of an asteroid can be used to determine the scale of the Solar System and distance of the sun. In 1931, Eros approached within 16 million miles of Earth, closer than any planet. Fourteen observatories in nine countries tracked it. After the decade that followed, the distance of the sun was determined to be 93,005,000 miles.	Harold Spencer Jones	England	distance-of-the-sun, eros	Space	Ten years of calculation followed, and by 1941 Jones was able to announce that the distance of the Sun was 93,005,000 miles. That was the most accurate determination yet and was probably the best that could be done until methods transcending the accuracy of parallax determination were devised.		
jet-planes	1941	Jet planes	Jet planes, propelled by engines based on burning fuel and ejecting exhaust at high speed, were first flown in 1941. They offered more efficiency over rockets by utilizing atmospheric oxygen and became significant post-World War II.	Frank Whittle	England	liquid-fuel-rockets, airplane	Science: Engineering	During the forty-year history of airflight, planes had been propelled through the air by the aptly named propeller. There was no question, though, that a plane could also be made to move through the air, perhaps even more quickly and efficiently, by means of the rocket principle—by burning fuel and ejecting a jet of exhaust gas at high speed (such planes are therefore called jet planes). The advantage jet planes had over rockets such as those developed by Goddard (see 1926) was that they traveled through the atmosphere, so they needed to carry only fuel and could make use of the oxygen in the surrounding air as the oxidizer. Plans for engines that made some use of the jet principle can be traced back to 1921, but the first patent for a jet engine of the type used today was obtained by a British aeronautical engineer, Frank Whittle (b. 1907), in 1930. The first jet plane making use of Whittle's engine was flown in May 1941. Jet planes were developed too late to play much of a role in World War II, but they came into their own afterward.		
neurospora	1941	Neurospora	Neurospora crassa is a mold which in its wild state grows on sugar and a variety of inorganic compounds. Bombarding this mold with x-rays causes it to mutate and sometimes lose the ability to form specific organic compounds. Beadle concluded that the characteristic function of the gene was to supervise the formation of a particular enzyme (one gene to each enzyme).	George Wells Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum	United States	fruit-flies, x-rays-and-mutations	Science: Genetics	Often genetics takes a step forward with the introduction of a simpler organism for study, as was the case, for instance, when Morgan began to study fruit flies (see 1907). The American geneticist George Wells Beadle (1903-1989), in collaboration with the American biochemist Edward Lawrie Tatum (1909-1975), began to work in 1941 with a mold called Neurospora crassa. In the wild state, this mold will grow on a nutrient medium in which sugar is the only significant organic compound. For its supply of elements not present in sugar, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, Neurospora can make do with inorganic compounds. If Neurospora are bombarded with X rays, using Muller's technique (see 1927), however, mutations take place. Some of the mutated Neurospora lose the ability to form a particular organic compound necessary for growth, so that it has to be added to the nutrient medium. Beadle found that it was not always necessary to add the missing compound itself to the medium— a different but similar compound might do. This meant that the similar compound could be converted into the necessary one. By trying a variety of similar compounds and noting which would promote growth and which would not, Beadle could deduce the sequence of chemical reactions and locate the step that the mutated mold could not manage. From his work, Beadle concluded that the characteristic function of the gene was to supervise the formation of a particular enzyme (one gene to each enzyme). A mutation took place when a gene was so altered that it could no longer form a normal enzyme. For this work, Beadle and Tatum were awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1958.		
nuclear-reactor	1942	Nuclear reactor	The first nuclear reactor was developed as part of the Manhattan Project. It involved creating a chain reaction using uranium, graphite, and cadmium rods, marking the beginning of the atomic age.	Leo Szilard and Enrico Fermi	United States	nuclear-chain-reaction, cadmium-lithium-selenium	Science: Physics	Szilard’s notion of a nuclear chain reaction (see 1939) could not be made practical. Once the Manhattan Project had been put in motion (see 1941), Fermi was placed in charge of producing such a chain reaction. Uranium and uranium oxide were piled up in combination with graphite blocks in a structure called an atomic pile. Neutrons colliding with the carbon atoms in graphite did not affect the carbon nuclei but bounced off, giving up their energy and moving more slowly as a result, thus increasing their chance of reacting with uranium-235. Making the pile as large as possible made it more likely that neutrons would strike uranium-235 before blundering out of the pile altogether and into the open air. The necessary size was the critical mass. Naturally, the more enriched in uranium-235 the pile was, the smaller the critical mass needed to be. Cadmium rods were inserted into the pile, because cadmium would soak up neutrons and keep the pile from becoming active prematurely. When the pile was large enough, the cadmium rods were slowly withdrawn and the number of neutrons produced slowly increased. At some point, the increase would reach the level where more were being produced than were being harmlessly consumed by the cadmium. At that time the nuclear chain reaction would begin and the whole thing would go out of control in a moment. What stopped that from happening was that some neutrons didn’t come out of the bombarded nuclei at once. In other words, after the pile went critical, there was a slight pause before the delayed neutrons were emitted and everything went awry. During that pause, the cadmium rods could be shoved in again. At 3:45 p.m. on December 2, 1942, in the squash court of the University of Chicago, the chain reaction became self-sustaining and was choked off. The atomic age had begun. The atomic pile was the first nuclear reactor.		
biotin	1942	Biotin	Biotin, also called vitamin H, was identified and its structure determined due to its effects on alleviating certain symptoms that other vitamins could not.	Vincent du Vigneaud	United States	vitamin-k	Science: Biology	At this time a new vitamin could only be detected by noting that certain foods or food extracts could correct symptoms that known vitamins would not touch. One such new vitamin was called vitamin H. The American biochemist Vincent du Vigneaud (1901–1978) isolated tiny quantities of vitamin H in reasonably pure form, as judged by its powerful effect on the symptoms it could alleviate, and by 1942 had worked out its rather complicated two-ring structure. The compound was now called biotin. It was synthesized and its structure proven.		
bacteriophage-structure	1942	Bacteriophage structure	The electron microscope allowed for detailed images of bacteriophages, revealing their structure for the first time. The discovery showed that bacteriophages consisted of a rounded head and thin tail.	Salvador Edward Luria	Italy	electron-microscope, bacteriophages	Science: Microbiology	The electron microscope (see 1932) had reached a pitch of excellence by now and could show viral structure as ordinary light microscopes could show cellular structure. In 1942 the Italian-born American microbiologist Salvador Edward Luria (b. 1912) managed to get good photographs of bacteriophages. These were unusually large viruses, to be sure, but they were considerably smaller than bacterial cells. Luria showed that the bacteriophage consisted of a rounded head and a thin tail, rather like an extremely small sperm cell. This was the first time a virus had been seen as anything more than a vague dot.		
adrenocorticotrophic-hormone	1943	Adrenocorticotrophic hormone	A hormone, ACTH, was isolated from the pituitary gland which stimulates the adrenal cortex. It functions similarly to cortisone and plays a critical role in hormone regulation.	Choh Hao Li	United States	corticoids	Science: Biology	It was becoming more obvious that the pituitary gland was a particularly important source of protein hormones, some of which activated and controlled other glands, such as the thyroid and the gonads. In 1943, the Chinese-born American biochemist Choh Hao Li (b. 1913) isolated, from the pituitary, a hormone that stimulated the adrenal cortex, using it to produce and release the cortical hormones (see 1935, Cortisone). This pituitary hormone was named adrenocorticotrophic hormone, a name usually abbreviated ACTH. It had the same effect on the body as cortisone, though more indirectly.		
lysergic-acid-diethylamide	1943	Lysergic acid diethylamide	Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a hallucinogenic drug synthesized from lysergic acid. It became known for its powerful hallucinogenic effects and influenced the drug culture in America.	Albert Hoffman	Switzerland	medicinal-plants	Science: Chemistry	In 1913 a Swiss chemist, Albert Hoffman (b. 1906), was working with lysergic acid, which is obtained from ergot, a mold that produces serious and sometimes deadly disorders in the human body. Hoffman modified it to form the diethyl amide of the compound and apparently absorbed some of the substance. He was overcome by strange sensations, vivid fantasies, and brilliant colors. He deliberately swallowed a tiny bit more of the material—and the results were even more weird. He had clearly suffered from hallucinations, so that lysergic acid diethylamide (usually abbreviated LSD) came to be called a hallucinogen, or a psychedelic drug. Other hallucinogens occur in nature, in certain mushrooms, in peyote cactus, and elsewhere. Even alcohol in sufficient quantities becomes hallucinogenic. Hallucinogens have been widely used in religious ceremonies, presumably because they seem to offer a vision of another world. LSD was a particularly effective hallucinogen, and in time its use became a fad among young people, which helped fasten the drug culture on America.		
seyfert-galaxies	1943	Seyfert galaxies	Seyfert galaxies are a type of active galaxy with bright centers that exhibit unusual activity. They make up about 1% of all galaxies and have become a significant area of study in astronomy.	Carl K. Seyfert	United States	galaxy-observed, supernovas	Space	Over twenty years had passed since it had become clear that there were innumerable galaxies lying deep in space, but there didn’t seem much hope of learning any significant details about the inner structures of objects that were millions of light-years distant. In 1943, however, the American astronomer Carl K. Seyfert (1911–1960) detected an odd galaxy with a very bright spot at the center. Other galaxies of the sort have since been observed, and the entire group is known as Seyfert galaxies. Altogether perhaps 1 percent of all galaxies are Seyfert galaxies. This was the first case of what came to be called active galaxies, those with centers that seem to be the site of activity beyond the normal. Much more remained to be discovered about such galaxies when it became possible to observe them outside the range of visible light.		
aqualung	1943	Aqualung	The Aqualung is a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus that provides divers with air under pressure, allowing them mobility and freedom underwater. This invention facilitated the observation of underwater life and introduced scuba diving as a new sport.	Jacques-Yves Cousteau	France	bathysphere, popular-mountain-climbing	Science: Marine Biology	In 1943, even while he was with the French underground fighting the occupying Germans, the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau (b. 1910) invented the Aqualung. This was a device that supplied the diver with air under pressure. It was self-contained and light, so that with an Aqualung and finned devices on their feet, divers could probe under the water's surface with freedom and mobility. This made it possible to observe coral reefs and ocean life in the uppermost layers of the ocean and also introduced a new sport, scuba diving. (Scuba is an acronym for 'self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.')		
dna-as-genetic-material	1944	DNA as genetic material	It was understood that chromosomes carried genetic material, but most thought that like heme and coenzymes, the nucleic acid was secondary to the protein. However it was confirmed that only the DNA and not the protein is the genetic material carried by chromosomes.	Oswald Theodore Avery	United States	chromosome, heme, coenzyme, genes	Science: Genetics	By now it had been understood for some forty years that chromosomes carried the genetic material. It was also known that chromosomes were nucleoprotein in character, containing both protein molecules and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. It was assumed that the key portion of the genetic material in chromosomes was the protein, since at every point proteins seemed to be the key to living tissue. They were giant molecules of enormous variety and versatility; the enzymes, which controlled the chemistry of the body, were proteins. The nucleic acid was thought to consist of relatively small molecules that behaved as adjuncts, like the heme in hemoglobin or the coenzymes in enzymes - though what the function of the nucleic acid adjunct might be was not known.		
paper-chromatography	1944	Paper chromatography	Paper chromatography was invented as an efficient technique for separating complex mixtures, particularly protein fragments. This improvement over previous chromatography methods allowed for more precise analysis and required only drops of solution.	Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge	England	chromatography	Science: Chemistry	In 1944 two British biochemists, Archer John Porter Martin (b. 1910) and Richard Laurence Millington Synge (b. 1914), invented paper chromatography. Instead of dripping the mixture through a column of absorbent powder, this technique allowed it to creep up a column of absorbent filter paper. The paper could then be turned at right angles and dipped into another solvent, so that if the first did not separate the mixture entirely, the second, working on an already partially separated mixture, would complete the job. It was an excellent technique for separating the complex mixtures that formed when a protein molecule was broken into fragments. For this work, Martin and Synge were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1952.		
teflon	1944	Teflon	The development of Teflon arose from intensive studies of fluorine compounds in the development of the nuclear bomb. Fluorine atoms held much more tightly to the carbon chain than hydrogen atoms did, so long-chain polytetra-fluoroethylene (or Teflon for short) had great properties: it didn't burn, dis- solve, or stick to anything.	Roy J. Plunkett	United States	uranium-hexafluoride	Science: Chemistry	The need to make use of uranium hexafluoride in the development of the nuclear bomb (see 1940) led to an intensive study of fluorine compounds and in particular of fluorocarbons. These were molecules in which all the free valences of a carbon chain or ring were occupied by fluorine atoms. It was possible to develop long chains of carbon atoms with fluorine atoms.		
synthesis-of-quinine	1944	Synthesis of quinine	Organic synthesis methods had advanced to such an extent that complex molecules could now be synthesized, including quinine. This development opened the door for the synthesis of other complicated molecules.	Robert Burns Woodward and William von Eggers Doering	United States	quinine, organic-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	By now the techniques and methods of organic synthesis were so advanced that any organic molecule, no matter how complex, could be synthesized. Perkin had attempted to synthesize quinine (see 1856) but was bound to fail, since its molecule was too complex for the methods then available. In 1944, however, the American chemists Robert Burns Woodward (1917–1979) and William von Eggers Doering (b. 1917) began with simple compounds that could be easily synthesized from their constituent elements, and from these they synthesized quinine. Woodward went on to synthesize other complicated molecules and was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1965.		
2,4-d	1944	2,4-D	2,4-D, the first effective chemical herbicide, was introduced. It selectively eliminates broad-leaved plants without seriously affecting grasses and grains.	Judah Hirsch Quastel	England	ddt	Science: Biology	The chemical 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D for short) was introduced in 1944 and was the first effective chemical herbicide (Latin for “plant killer”). Naturally, killing plant life indiscriminately is not something one would want to do, but 2,4-D is selective in its effects. It does not seriously affect grasses (including the various grains so important to humanity) but prevents the growth of broad-leaved plants, usually regarded as weeds.		
new-nebular-hypothesis	1944	New nebular hypothesis	A new version of the nebular hypothesis introduced turbulence in the outer layers of the nebula to explain planet formation in observed orbits. The principles of magnetohydrodynamics further explained the movement of gases in magnetic fields.	Carl Friedrich Weizsacker and Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén	Germany and Sweden	nebular-hypothesis, planetesimal-hypothesis, gravitational-deflection-of-light	Space	For nearly two centuries, astronomers had been trying to work out some reasonable mechanism that would account for the formation of the Solar System. Laplace’s nebular hypothesis (see 1796) had broken down over the fact that 98 percent of the angular momentum of the Solar System was concentrated in the planets, which made up only 0.1 percent of the total mass of the system. Chamberlin had advanced the planetesimal theory (see 1905), which required a near collision that would draw out solar matter by gravitational pull and form the planets. Eddington (see 1919), however, showed the interior of stars to be so incredibly hot that matter pulled out of the Sun would simply disperse and not collect into planets. In 1944 Weizsacker (see 1938) worked out a new version of the nebular hypothesis. He introduced the notion of turbulence in the outer layers of the condensing nebula and showed how, as a result of such turbulence, planets would form in their actual observed orbits, more or less. Furthermore, the development of magnetohydrodynamics at just about this time, by the Swedish astronomer Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén (b. 1908), showed how thin gases moved when immersed in magnetic fields and how they could carry energy and angular momentum outward. This solved the		
radio-waves-from-hydrogen	1944	Radio waves from hydrogen	Van de Hulst theorized that cold hydrogen atoms should emit detectable 21-centimeter radio waves in space. Because of the German occupation, instrumentation was not available and so his calculations could not yet be corroborated.	Hendrik Christoffel van de Hulst	Netherlands	radio-telescope	Space	In German-occupied Europe, scientific work could proceed only with extreme difficulty. The Dutch astronomer Hendrik Christoffel van de Hulst (b. 1918) was forced to do what work he could with theoretical notions that required no more in the way of instrumentation than pen and paper. He considered the behavior of cold hydrogen atoms and worked out how the magnetic fields associated with the proton and the electron in the hydrogen atom were oriented to each other. They could line up in the same direction or in opposite directions. Every once in a while a particular atom could flip from one configuration to another, and in so doing, it would emit a radio wave 21 centimeters in length. Any single hydrogen atom ought to do this only once in eleven million years or so on the average, but there were so many such atoms in space that a continuing drizzle of 21-centimeter radiation should be emitted, a drizzle that might be intense enough to be detectable. Jansky’s discovery had shown that radio waves were emitted by objects in the sky (see 1932), but beyond Reber’s simple radio telescope (see 1937) there was nothing with which to observe such radio waves in any detail. Van de Hulst’s calculations had to wait for corroboration.		
americium-and-curium	1944	Americium and curium	Seaborg and his associates created elements americium (95) and curium (96) by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and alpha particles. These discoveries expanded the periodic table beyond plutonium, and honored America and the Curies.	Glenn T. Seaborg	United States	neptunium-and-plutonium, polonium-and-radium	Science: Chemistry	After Seaborg had helped McMillan isolate plutonium (see 1940), it was clear that other elements might exist beyond that element. Seaborg devoted himself to the task of preparing such elements by bombarding the massive atoms already known with subatomic particles. In 1944, by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and alpha particles, Seaborg and his associates prepared americium, with an atomic number of 95, and curium, with an atomic number of 96. The former was named for America and the latter for the Curies (see 1897).		
v-two	1944	V-2	The V-2 rocket, developed in Germany, was the first true missile carrying its own fuel and oxygen, first launched at London in 1944. 4300 were fired, 1230 hit London causing thousands of dead and wounded civilians.	Wernher von Braun	Germany	liquid-fuel-rockets	War	Since Goddard flew the first liquid-fueled rocket (see 1926), his work had been taken most seriously in Germany, where a group of 870 enthusiasts, including Wernher von Braun (see 1942), had begun experimenting with rockets in 1930. Hitler favored rocket work for military use, and in 1936 von Braun headed a research project for the purpose of developing military rockets. In 1942 the first true missile, carrying its own fuel and oxygen, was shot off and reached a height of 60 miles. On September 7, 1944, such missiles, called V-2s, with the V standing for vergeltung (vengeance), were first fired at London. (The V-1 had been a pilotless airplane wired with explosives, not nearly as damaging as the V-2.) In all, 4,300 V-2s were fired; 1,230 hit London. Casualties included 2,511 dead and 5,869 seriously wounded. These missiles were armed with only chemical explosives, however, and came too late in the war to save Germany.		
nuclear-fission-bomb	1945	Nuclear fission bomb	A nuclear fission bomb, requiring a critical mass of fissile material, was detonated successfully in New Mexico in 1945. This invention drastically changed the face of war due to its immense explosive power.	J. Robert Oppenheimer	United States	nuclear-chain-reaction, uranium-hexafluoride	War	For a nuclear chain reaction to take place (see 1939), it is necessary to accumulate enough fissile material (uranium-235 or an appropriate plutonium isotope manufactured from uranium-238) to bring about an explosion. The amount of fissile material has to be large enough (the critical mass) for enough of the neutrons produced to strike other nuclei before wandering out into open air. If two pieces of fissile material, each below the critical mass and therefore nonexploding, are fired into each other to form a single piece above the critical mass, any stray neutron (and there are always some around) will start the chain reaction and the material will explode in a fraction of a second. By mid-1945 enough fissile material had been collected to carry through a test. On July 16, 1945, at a site 60 miles northwest of the town of Alamogordo, New Mexico, a nuclear fission bomb (popularly called an atomic bomb, or an A-bomb) made of plutonium was detonated before dawn. The scientists in charge had expected an explosive force equivalent to 5,000 tons of TNT. What they got was the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT. At a stroke, the face of war had changed totally. It was even possible that the fate of humanity had been sealed.		
synchrocyclotron	1945	Synchrocyclotron	By the time cyclotron-accelerated particles reached energies of 20 MeV, their mass increased so much that they curved less sharply. McMillan worked out a method for synchronizing the magnetic field in such a way that the alternations of the magnetic field slowed and kept time with the mass increase of the particles.

promethium	1945	Promethium	A group discovered element number 61, named promethium, with its most stable isotope having a half-life of 17.7 years. This element filled the gap in the periodic table below uranium.	Charles Du-Bois Coryell	United States	neptunium-and-plutonium	Science: Chemistry	In 1945 a group under the direction of the American chemist Charles Du-Bois Coryell (b. 1912) discovered element number 61 among the fission products of uranium. Its most nearly stable isotope had a half-life of 17.7 years. It was eventually named promethium, because just as the Greek god Prometheus had snatched fire from the nuclear furnace of the Sun, so promethium had been snatched from the nuclear furnace of the fissioning uranium atoms.		
viral-mutations	1945	Viral mutations	Luria showed that bacteriophages undergo mutations, making it difficult to develop lasting immunity to viral diseases. This discovery influenced understanding of viral disease immunity.	Alfred Day Hershey	United States	bacteriophage-structure, evolution-and-mutation	Science: Biology	In 1945 Luria (see 1942) and, independently, the American microbiologist Alfred Day Hershey (b. 1908) showed that bacteriophages underwent mutations as well. It is for this reason that it is so hard to develop immunity to viral diseases like flu and the common cold. Antibodies might be developed against a particular strain of the virus, but then a mutation will produce a new strain against which the old antibodies are not effective. For their work, Luria and Hershey received shares of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1969.		
jet-streams	1945	Jet streams	High-altitude winds known as jet streams were recognized as a permanent atmospheric feature. These winds, found at the troposphere-stratosphere boundary, can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour.	Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby 	Sweden	jet-planes, gulf-stream	Geography	During World War II, both Japanese and American pilots in high-flying planes became aware of a high-altitude wind blowing from west to east. The Japanese, making the discovery as early as 1942, used the wind in an effort to blow balloon-bombs across the Pacific Ocean to the United States. The Americans became aware of the wind when flying to bomb Japan in 1944. By 1945 these high winds had been recognized as a permanent feature of the atmosphere. There were several bands of such winds blowing at the troposphere-stratosphere boundary. These bands were hundreds of miles wide and several miles deep. Speeds of up to 300 miles per hour were measured. These were called jet streams.		
artificial-kidneys	1945	Artificial kidneys	An artificial kidney was designed to keep people with kidney failure alive by filtering urea from their blood. This invention marked the beginning of modern artificial organs.	Willem J. Kolff	America	urea-cycle	Science: Medicine	The era of modern artificial organs was initiated in 1945, when the Dutch-born American inventor Willem J. Kolff designed an artificial kidney. People suffering from kidney failure could then be kept alive by periodically filtering urea out of their bloodstream.		
eniac	1946	ENIAC	ENIAC was the first practical electronic digital computer, created by replacing mechanical parts with radio tubes for switches. Despite its large size and energy use, it marked the beginning of the electronic computing era, leading to more capable and efficient computers.	John William Mauchly and John Presper Eckart Jr	United States	computer	Science: Mathematics	Bush had devised a computer that made use of radio tubes as electronic switches in addition to the usual mechanical parts (see 1930). The obvious next step was to make an entirely electronic computer, with no moving mechanical parts at all. This was done by the American engineers John William Mauchly (1907-1980) and John Presper Eckart, Jr. (b. 1919), who devised the first practical electronic digital computer in 1946. It was called ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer). It was an enormous, energy-guzzling device, weighing 30 tons and taking up 1,500 square feet of space. Though it was a wonder of its time, ENIAC was retired some nine years after it had been set up. It was by then hopelessly obsolete, for its descendants were growing steadily smaller, cheaper, more efficient, and much more capable	Swiss-German	
microwave-reflection-from-the-moon	1946	Microwave reflection from the moon	A Hungarian scientist used radar technology to detect microwave reflections from the Moon, allowing precise calculations of its distance. This innovation demonstrated the potential of radar for astronomical measurements.	Zoltan Lajos Bay	Hungary	radar, magnetrons	Space	Thanks to radar, it was possible to detect microwave reflections from airplanes, and from the reflections to calculate the distance and direction of the airplanes. In principle, there was no reason this could not be done for an astronomical body. In 1946 a Hungarian scientist, Zoltan Lajos Bay, sent a beam of microwaves to the Moon and detected the reflection. The time it took for the reflection to return could be used to determine the distance of the Moon at the time of reflection with far greater precision than had ever been possible before.	Hungarian	
nuclear-magnetic-resonance	1946	Nuclear magnetic resonance	Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a technique for noninvasively studying the interior of living organisms using microwave radiation absorbed in a magnetic field. It is less harmful than X-rays and is particularly effective at detecting light atoms, making it valuable for medical diagnostics.	Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell	United States	electron-microscope, x-rays	Science: Physics	It is possible for chemical substances to absorb certain frequencies of microwave radiation when those substances are in a strong, steady, and homogeneous magnetic field. The frequencies that are absorbed depend on the magnetic properties of the atoms involved. In particular, atomic nuclei act as tiny spinning magnets, and these can be lined up in a magnetic field, to strengthen the microwave absorption. The Swiss-born American physicist Felix Bloch (1905-1983) and the American physicist Edward Mills Purcell (b. 1912) independently developed this technique in 1946, and for it they shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1952. The technique, named nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), provided a noninvasive way of studying the interior of living organisms. Since microwaves are far less energetic than X rays, they are correspondingly less likely to do damage to tissues. Then too, X rays are best at detecting massive atoms, of which there are few in the body, while NMR detects light atoms, particularly hydrogen, and these are plentiful in the body. The use of NMR is growing more common, but because of public fears of the word nuclear (thinking that it implies the existence.	Bloch Jewish	
noradrenaline	1946	Noradrenaline	The neurotransmitter noradrenaline, similar to adrenaline but differing by a carbon atom, was discovered in the sympathetic nervous system. This discovery led to an important understanding of nerve impulses.	Ulf Svante von Euler	Sweden	adrenocorticotrophic-hormone, epinephrine	Science: Biology	It was already known that acetylcholine was a chemical that served to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to a neighboring neuron. In 1946 the Swedish physiologist Ulf Svante von Euler showed that in that part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nerves, the transmitting chemical was noradrenaline (more properly, norepinephrine), which was very much like the hormone adrenaline in structure but was missing a carbon atom. Von Euler received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1979 for this discovery.	Swedish	
bacterial-genetics	1946	Bacterial genetics	This discovery proved that bacterial reproduction isn't solely asexual and that different strains could intermix genetic material, enabling bacterial sexual reproduction. This fundamentally changed the understanding of bacterial genetics and reproduction.	Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum	United States	dna-as-genetic-material, bacteriology	Science: Biology	It had long been customary to think of reproduction in the simplest organisms as essentially simpler than that in multicellular ones. In 1946, the American geneticist Joshua Lederberg, working with Tatum, showed that bacterial reproduction was not entirely asexual. Different strains of bacteria could be crossed in such a way as to make the genetic material intermingle. It was therefore possible for organisms even as simple as bacteria to engage, on occasion, in what is essentially sexual reproduction.	Lederberg jewish	
virus-genetics	1946	Virus genetics	Genetic materials of different virus strains can combine to create entirely new strains, similar to sexual reproduction in more complex organisms. This discovery highlighted the complexity of virus genetics.	Max Delbrück and Alfred Day Hershey	United States	dna-as-genetic-material, viral-mutations	Science: Biology	While Lederberg was showing the unexpected complexity of bacterial reproduction, the German-born American microbiologist Max Delbrück and Alfred Day Hershey showed that the genetic material of different strains of viruses could be combined to form a new strain different from either. This too is a form of sexual reproduction, and for this Delbrück and Hershey received shares of the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1969.		
cloud-seeding	1946	Cloud-seeding	Scientists used solid carbon dioxide to induce ice crystals and create a miniature snowstorm, exploring the possibility of cloud-seeding. This method, however, proved impractical as its success depended heavily on existing weather conditions.	Schaefer	United States	jet-streams, stratospheric-balloons	Science: Meteorology	During a heat wave, Schaefer dropped some solid carbon dioxide into the box to cool it more effectively. Promptly, ice crystals formed and a miniature snowstorm whirled inside the box. Solid carbon dioxide might therefore help in cloud-seeding. On November 13, 1946, Schaefer was flown by airplane over a cloud layer in western Massachusetts and dumped 6 pounds of pellets of frozen carbon dioxide. A snowstorm started. In mild weather, such an artificial snowstorm started at high altitudes would, of course, turn to rain as it fell. Nevertheless, rain-making never became important. In the first place, it worked only if the proper kinds of clouds were present—in other words, if it was likely to rain in any case. In the second place, rain that might be helpful to some people would invariably be harmful to others, so that to make rain artificially would be to ask for an infinite amount of litigation.		
pion	1947	Pion	The pion is a particle predicted to hold protons and neutrons together within the nucleus, despite electromagnetic repulsion. It shares some properties with more massive particles and interacts with protons and neutrons, fulfilling Yukawa's prediction.	Cecil Frank Powell	England	strong-interaction, synchrocyclotron	Science: Physics	Yukawa had predicted the existence of a particle with mass between that of an electron and a proton. It would serve as an exchange particle, holding together the protons and neutrons within the nucleus despite the electromagnetic repulsion among the protons (see 1935, Strong Interaction). Anderson detected a particle of intermediate mass, the muon (see 1937), but it lacked the necessary properties to fulfill the role Yukawa had laid out for it. Meanwhile, the English physicist Cecil Frank Powell (1903–1969) had worked out a new method of particle detection. Instead of having particles strike a cloud chamber and then photographing the results, he had the particles strike a photographic emulsion so that the result could be recorded directly. In 1947 he exposed photographic plates in the Bolivian Andes and picked up evidence of a particle of intermediate mass that was not the one Anderson had discovered. Powell named it the pi-meson, which was eventually shortened to pion. Whereas Anderson’s muon had all the properties of an electron except for its greater mass, so that it was a lepton, the pion shared certain properties with the more massive particles and was lumped with them as a hadron. The pion interacted readily with protons and neutrons (as the muon did not) and had all the properties required for it to be Yukawa’s predicted particle. For this work, Powell was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1950.		
carbon-14-dating	1947	Carbon-14 dating	Carbon-14 dating uses the predictable radioactive decay of carbon-14 to determine the age of organic materials. This technique allows scientists to accurately measure how long it has been since a plant or animal died.	Willard Frank Libby	United States	radioactive-dating, isotopes, carbon-dioxide	Science: Chemistry	Seven years before, Martin David Kamen had discovered carbon-14 and found it to have a surprisingly long half-life, some 5,700 years. In 1947 the American chemist Willard Frank Libby (1908–1980) put the isotope to important use. It had turned out that cosmic ray bombardment converted some of the nitrogen-14 of the atmosphere into carbon-14. New carbon-14 was formed as old carbon-14 broke down radioactively, so that an equilibrium was achieved. A given very small quantity of it always remained in the Earth’s atmosphere. Libby reasoned that plants absorbed carbon dioxide in the course of photosynthesis, so that carbon atoms from the gas found their way into the molecules of plant tissues. This must include a very small quantity of carbon-14, since it was always present in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Despite the fact that this was present in terribly small amounts, its concentration could be determined because the beta particles it liberated could be detected with great precision. Once a plant died, however, no further carbon-14 would be absorbed, so that what carbon-14 it contained would slowly break down without being replaced. By determining the concentration of carbon-14 in the remains of a once-living plant, the amount of time that had elapsed since the organism had died could be determined with surprising accuracy.		
crab-nebula-as-radio-source	1947	Crab nebula as radio source	The Crab Nebula was identified as a significant radio source in 1947 by using radio telescopes. This marked the first discovery of an optical object being a radio source, demonstrating the potential of radio astronomy for making new discoveries.	John C. Bolton	Australia	radio-waves-from-space, radio-telescope	Space	It had been sixteen years since Jansky first detected radio waves from outer space (see 1932), but only since World War II had techniques been developed that permitted handling of the microwave radiation used in radar. These techniques could now be applied to astronomy. In 1947 the Australian astronomer John C. Bolton had a radio telescope that was capable of locating a radio source with sufficient precision to associate it with an object that could be identified optically. Thus he found that the third strongest radio source in the sky was clearly the Crab Nebula, which was the remains of a great supernova explosion (see 1054). The Crab Nebula was the first optical object discovered to be a radio source, and this was the first indication that radio astronomy might offer a technique for making discoveries that were not apparent from the simple study of visible light itself.		
martian-atmosphere	1947	Martian atmosphere	In 1947, infrared analysis revealed that Mars' atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide with no nitrogen, oxygen, or water vapor. This discovery diminished the hypothesis of advanced life forms on Mars.	Gerard Peter Kuiper	United States	new-nebular-hypothesis, martian-canals	Space	Since Schiaparelli had first detected the “canals” of Mars (see 1877), a feeling had persisted among nonastronomers, and even among some astronomers, that there might be life on Mars. In 1947, however, the Dutch-born American astronomer Gerard Peter Kuiper (1905-1973) analyzed the reflected infrared light of Mars and reported that the Martian atmosphere seemed to be almost entirely carbon dioxide. There was no sign of nitrogen, oxygen, or water vapor. With that, the notion of an advanced civilization on Mars, or of any but possibly the simplest forms of life, went glimmering.		
coenzyme-a	1947	Coenzyme A	In 1947, coenzyme A was isolated as a crucial substance for transferring acetyl groups during metabolism. It includes pantothenic acid, a necessary B vitamin, playing an indispensable role in metabolic processes.	Fritz Albert Lipmann	United States	coenzyme-structure, vitamins	Science: Biology	The carbohydrates, fats, and proteins of food, in the course of their metabolism, all break down to an acetyl group, also called a two-carbon fragment. This is then built up again to form the substances characteristic of an organism's own tissues. In 1947 Lippman (see 1941) was able to isolate a substance that was essential to the transfer of the acetyl group from one compound to another. He called it coenzyme A, where the A stood for acetyl group. The structure of coenzyme A was found to include that of pantothenic acid, one of the B vitamins. Pantothenic acid is essential to life and must be present in our food, because the human body cannot form it within its own tissues, cannot form coenzyme A without it, and cannot run metabolic changes without coenzyme A.		
chloramphenicol	1947	Chloramphenicol	Chloramphenicol was isolated from molds that also produced streptomycin, becoming the first broad-spectrum antibiotic. This added to the growing list of antibiotics available for medical 			penicillin-practical, streptomycin	Science: Medicine	During World War II, penicillin (see 1939) and streptomycin (see 1940) had been isolated and the age of antibiotics had begun. In 1947 chloramphenicol was isolated from the same group of molds that had yielded streptomycin.		
holography	1947	Holography	Holography involves splitting a beam of light enabling it to record three-dimensional images. It provides more information compared to traditional photography and achieves a 3D representation.	Dennis Gabor	England	photography, achromatic-lens	Science: Physics	Photography had been in existence for over a century (see 1839). It worked by allowing a beam of light to be reflected from an object and fall upon a photographic film. The film recorded a two-dimensional pattern of the reflected beam, but the information was limited by the loss of the third dimension. Suppose, instead, that a beam of light were split in two. One part would strike an object and be reflected with all the irregularities the object would impose on it. The second part would be reflected from a mirror, with no irregularities imposed on it. The two parts would meet at the photographic film, where the interference pattern would be recorded. The film, when developed, would then seem to be blank, but if light were made to pass through the film, it would take on the interference characteristics and produce a three-dimensional image, conveying far more information than an ordinary photograph. The three-dimensional image would be called a holograph (where the prefix means "the whole thing"—that is, all three dimensions). This notion was first worked out in 1947 by a Hungarian-born British physicist, Dennis Gabor (1900-1979), but though the theory was sound, it could not be reduced to practice without further advances in optics. Once such advances took place, Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, in 1971.		
land-camera	1947	Land camera	The Land camera produced instant positive photographs without needing negatives. It simplified the photography process by integrating film and chemical development in a single device.	Edwin Land	United States	home-photography	Science: Technology	In 1947 Land (see 1932) produced the Land camera, which produced not negatives but positive prints, completely developed soon after the photograph was taken. The camera had a double roll of film consisting of ordinary negative film and a positive paper with sealed containers of chemicals between. The chemicals were released at the proper moment and developed the positive print automatically.		
supersonic-flight	1947	Supersonic flight	Supersonic flight involves aircraft capable of flying faster than the speed of sound. Overcoming the sound barrier enables advanced air travel and high-speed aviation technology.	Charles Elwood Yeager	United States	jet-planes, mach-number	Science: Technology	Since the invention of the airplane (see 1903), planes had been going faster and faster, but propellers can only whirl so fast and it seemed that the speed limit for planes was bound to be less than the speed of sound, which is about 740 miles per hour. Once jet planes were devised during World War II (see 1941), however, the possibility of planes moving faster than sound (supersonic flight) arose. The difficulty is that, at their fastest, air molecules move at the speed of sound. As long as a plane moves at a lesser speed, the air molecules ahead will move easily out of the way. At the speed of sound or beyond, the air molecules cannot move out of the way before being overtaken. They pile up ahead of the plane, which thus flies into compressed air. This was viewed, dramatically, as flying into a wall, and people began to speak of a sound barrier. Actually, there is no such thing. Bullets and shells can move faster than sound, as can the tip of a bullwhip. As air piles up, it eventually slips to one side.		
television-in-the-home	1947	Television in the home	Television was refined from a laboratory concept to a consumer product, suitable for home use by 1947. This advancement revolutionized home entertainment, advertisement, show business, and politics.			color-television	Science: Technology	Television had been a laboratory reality for twenty years, but methods for producing pictures on a screen were far too crude and far too expensive for everyday use by the general public. By 1947, television sets could be produced that one could reasonably watch at home. The screens were small and fuzzy at first, and of course there were very few programs available for viewing. Improvements and elaborations came by leaps and bounds, however, and in a few years television was altering the concept of home entertainment, of advertisement, of show business, and even of politics.		
transistor	1948	Transistor	Transistors were discovered as more reliable and efficient alternatives to radio tubes, consisting of semiconductors that could serve multiple functions such as amplifying and rectifying electric current. They marked a significant technological advance, replacing radio tubes due to their small size, low energy consumption, and ruggedness.	William Bradford Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain, John Bardeen	United States	silicon, germanium, triode	Science: Electronics	When radio was in its infancy, crystals were used as rectifiers, allowing alternating current to pass in only one direction. These were unreliable, however, and such crystal sets were quickly replaced by sets containing radio tubes (see 1904), which had now been in use in various electronic instruments, including the new computers, for over forty years. Radio tubes have to be large enough to enclose a vacuum, however. They are fragile, spring leaks, and frequently have to be replaced. They are also energy-hungry, and one must wait for the filament to heat up before the machine starts working. In 1948 three physicists, William Bradford Shockley (b. 1910), Walter Houser Brattain (1902-1987), and John Bardeen (b. 1908)—all American, though Shockley was British-born—discovered a new kind of crystal. It consisted chiefly of germanium, which conducted an electric current less well than metals but better than such insulators as glass and rubber. Germanium—and silicon, which in a few years replaced germanium, since silicon was both cheaper and better—were considered examples of semiconductors. If traces of certain impurities were added to the semiconductor, the crystal could serve as a rectifier or as an amplifier. It could, in short, perform any function that tubes could. These semiconductors were solid (hence solid-state devices) and required no vacuum, so that they could be made quite small. They were rugged, so that they almost never needed replacing. They used very little energy, and they required no heating, so that they began working at once. A fellow worker, the American electrical engineer John Robinson Pierce (b. 1910), suggested that the device be called a transistor, because it transmitted current across a resistor. With time, transistors replaced tubes completely. Transistors and the improvements that followed may well prove to be the most significant technological advance of the twentieth century.		
long-playing-records	1948	Long-playing records	Long-playing records were developed to rotate at a slower speed of 33⅓ times a minute, allowing much more music to be stored on a single record. This innovation enabled entire symphonies to be placed on one record, significantly enhancing music listening experience.	Peter Carl Goldmark	United States	phonograph, telephone	Culture: Music	Until now, records had revolved at the rate of 78 times a minute. In 1948 the Hungarian-born American physicist Peter Carl Goldmark (1906–1977) developed a record that turned only 33⅓ times a minute. Between that and narrowing the track, or needle groove, six times more music could be placed on a single record than had been possible earlier. An entire symphony could now fit on one record.		
cybernetics	1948	Cybernetics	Cybernetics is a field developed to accurately analyze and predict movements and behaviors using advanced computers, initially driven by the need for precise antiaircraft defense. The field encompasses the study of mechanical and electronic systems for controlling and automating processes.	Norbert Wiener	United States	computer, symbolic-logic	Science: Computer Science	The American mathematician Norbert Wiener (1894–1964) spent World War II working on antiaircraft defense. To shoot down an attacking airplane, one must know the speed and direction of the plane’s movements, the speed and direction of the wind, the speed of the projectile aimed at the airplane, and other factors as well. To do all this accurately and well, computers were needed that were far better than those available at the time.		
nuclear-structure	1948	Nuclear structure	Nuclear structure explores the arrangement of protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei, proposing the concept of nuclear shells. Certain numbers of protons and neutrons, termed 'magic numbers,' confer extra stability to nuclei.	Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen	United States, Germany	nuclear-atom, proton-neutron-nucleus	Science: Physics	The chemical properties of atoms depend on the arrangement of their electrons into shells. This is what makes the periodic table of the elements work. The nuclear properties of atoms must depend on the arrangement of the protons and neutrons in the nuclei. They, too, might be arranged in shells, but if so, this would be more difficult to determine than in the case of the outer electrons. The German-born American physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1906–1972) tried to work out the nature of the nuclear shells from the nuclear properties that had been observed for different atoms. She showed that nuclei that contained 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, or 126 protons or neutrons would be more stable than their neighbors in the periodic table. These were called shell numbers, or more dramatically but less scientifically, magic numbers. If 28 or 40 protons or neutrons were present, some stability resulted, and these were called semi-magic numbers. Goeppert-Mayer advanced her notions in 1948, at about the same time a German physicist, Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen (1907–1973), advanced the same views. As a result, Goeppert-Mayer and Jensen received shares of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1963.		
quantum-electrodynamics	1948	Quantum electrodynamics	Quantum electrodynamics is a theory explaining the behavior of electrons and electromagnetic interactions with high precision. It has been essential in forming accurate predictions of subatomic phenomena.	Richard Phillips Feynman	United States	photoelectric-effect, quantized-atom	Science: Physics	Making use of quantum theory, the American physicist Richard Phillips Feynman (1918–1988), in 1948, worked out equations governing the behavior of electrons and electromagnetic interactions generally; equations that allowed predictions of such phenomena to be made with far greater precision than had been possible until then. This theory was called quantum electrodynamics, and it proved so successful that it has been used as a model for the attempted working out of equations governing the behavior of particles subjected to the weak and strong interactions. For this work, Feynman received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1965.		
the-big-bang	1948	The Big Bang	Gamow attempted to explain how the chemical elements were formed in the aftermath of the explosion of the Cosmic Egg. Predicted background radiation should exist and that the average temperature of the universe should be just a few degrees above absolute zero.	George Gamow	United States	cosmic-egg	Science: Physics			
miranda	1948	Miranda	A new fifth Uranian satellite, Miranda, was discovered, named after a character from Shakespeare's "The Tempest." It was the first satellite named after a human being, albeit a fictional one.	Gerard Kuiper	Netherlands	ariel-and-umbriel	Space	For almost a century, Uranus had been known to have four satellites. In 1948, however, Kuiper, who had described the atmosphere of Mars (see 1947), located a fifth Uranian satellite. It was smaller than the other four and closer to Uranus. Since three of the satellites had been named for spirits from Shakespeare's plays—Oberon and Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream and Ariel from The Tempest—Kuiper named the new satellite Miranda, after the heroine of The Tempest. Miranda was the first satellite to be named after a human being rather than a god, a goddess, or a spirit, although it was a fictional human being, to be sure.		
nucleic-acid-base-balance	1948	Nucleic acid-base balance	New discoveries in nucleic acid structures showed that guanine pairs with cytosine and adenine pairs with thymine, leading to a better understanding of DNA. These findings were crucial to understanding genetic information and its role in biological development.	Erwin Chargaff	United States	ribose, dna-as-genetic-material	Science: Biology	It was now known that nucleic acids were large and very complex molecules, especially since Avery had shown that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and not protein was the carrier of physical characteristics (see 1944). It was DNA, in short, that made up the genes of the chromosomes. The question was: Just what was it about the structure of nucleic acids that made it possible for them to carry the vast amount of information that genes must carry in order to make human eggs develop into human beings and grasshopper eggs into grasshoppers, without the reverse ever happening? Part of the structure of DNA was known to be four different bases. Two of them (adenine and guanine) were purines with a two-ring molecule, and two of them (cytosine and thymine) were pyrimidines with a one-ring molecule. The Austrian-born American biochemist Erwin Chargaff (b. 1905) broke down nucleic acid molecules to their constituent bases and separated them by paper chromatography. He determined the quantity of each present and by 1948 was able to demonstrate that, in nucleic acids generally, the number of guanine units was equal to the number of cytosine units, and the number of adenine units was equal to the number of thymine units. This meant that the number of purine units was equal to the number of pyrimidine units. This was a more important discovery than Chargaff apparently realized at the time, and he did not follow it up properly.		
cyanocobalamin	1948	Cyanocobalamin	The discovery of vitamin B-12 (cyanocobalamin) was found to be crucial for treating pernicious anemia and involved a complex molecule containing cyanide and cobalt. This discovery allowed for better vitamin B-12 detection and isolation, improving treatment methods.	Karl August Folkers	United States	riboflavin	Science: Biology	Minot and Murphy had demonstrated that there was a dietary factor in liver that reversed the onslaught of pernicious anemia (see 1926). The nature of the factor was not easily determined, however, since its presence or absence could only be detected by following the slow changes in pernicious anemia patients. In 1948, the American chemist Karl August Folkers (b. 1906) discovered that this factor, usually called vitamin B-12, was necessary for the growth of certain bacteria. The presence or absence of the vitamin in various fractions of liver could now easily be determined from the reaction of bacteria, and very soon, red crystals of the pure vitamin were isolated. Eventually, analysis showed the vitamin to have perhaps the most complicated molecule known that was not simply a long chain of repeated single units. It was required by the body in exceedingly small doses, a thousandth that of other vitamins. The molecule possessed a cyanide group and a cobalt atom, neither of which was present in other known substances in living tissue.		
cortisone-and-arthritis	1948	Cortisone and arthritis	Turned out that cortisone could alleviate rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, viewing it as a metabolic disorder.	Philip Showalter Hench	England	corticoids	Science: Medicine	The American physician Philip Showalter Hench (1896-1965) was interested in rheumatoid arthritis, a painful and crippling disease. He conjectured it was not a germ disease but a disorder of metabolism. By 1948, Hench tried various hormones, finding cortisone, isolated in 1946, effective in relieving symptoms. This finding earned him a Nobel Prize in 1950.		
tetracyclines	1948	Tetracyclines	Chlortetracycline was introduced as Aureomycin. This antibiotic is effective against many microorganisms and has low toxicity.	Benjamin Minge Duggar	United States	chloramphenicol	Science: Medicine	In 1948, the antibiotic chlortetracycline, discovered by American botanist Benjamin Minge Duggar (1872-1956), was released as Aureomycin. Its four-ringed structure marked it as the first of the tetracyclines family, effective against various microorganisms and low in toxicity, making it one of the safest antibiotics.		
tissue-transplantation	1948	Tissue transplantation	Histocompatibility genes are critical for tissue transplantation. These genes help manage the body's immune response, improving transplantation acceptance.	George Snell	United States	sutures, blood-types	Science: Medicine	In 1948, George Snell identified histocompatibility genes integral to tissue transplantation. Aiming to counter rejection and acceptance issues, these genes play a pivotal role in the immune response, easing tissue transplant procedures.		
virus-culture-penicillin	1948	Virus culture improved	Viruses only grow within living cells, not easily done in a lab because any living cell would also attract bacteria. To deal with this Enders developed the technique of using penicillin to prevent bacterial growth in chicken embryos making it possible to study the poliomyelitis virus in the lab.	John Franklin Enders	United States	virus-culture, penicillin-practical	Science: Microbiology	The ability to grow pure bacterial cultures revolutionized bacterial infection control over three-quarters of a century. This advancement laid the groundwork for significant progress in battling bacterial infections.		
starch-chromatography	1948	Starch chromatography	Starch chromatography was refined to use starch as an absorptive medium, enhancing the separation of amino acids and peptides. This technique significantly advanced biochemical analysis and won a Nobel Prize.	Stanford Moore and William Howard Stein	United States	paper-chromatography	Science: Biochemistry			
bathyscaphe	1948	Bathyscaphe	A new submersible vessel, the bathyscaphe, was invented to explore ocean depths independently of surface ships. This innovation enabled direct exploration of deep-sea environments.	Auguste Piccard	Switzerland	bathysphere	Science: Oceanography	In 1948, Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard invented the bathyscaphe, a vessel capable of deep ocean exploration. It allowed descent and ascent by releasing iron pellets and contained gasoline bubbles for buoyancy.		
icarus	1949	Icarus	Baade discovered the asteroid Icarus in 1949, which is an Earth-grazer and an Apollo-object. It closely approaches the Sun and Earth, named after the mythical Icarus.	Wilhelm Heinrich Walter Baade	Germany	hidalgo	Space	In 1949 Baade, who had discovered the asteroid Hidalgo (see 1920), discovered an asteroid that was an Earth-grazer, since it could come as close as 4,000,000 miles from Earth, and an Apollo-object too. Indeed, it approached the Sun more closely than Mercury did, skimming by at a distance of only 17,700,000 miles every 1.12 years. Baade named it Icarus, after the character in Greek mythology who lost his life when he flew on wax wings too close to the Sun.		
nereid	1949	Nereid	Kuiper discovered the satellite Nereid orbiting Neptune in 1949. It is noted for having the most eccentric orbit of any known satellite.	Gerard Kuiper	Netherlands	miranda	Space	Kuiper, who had discovered Miranda (see 1948), reported another far distant satellite in 1949. For a century only one satellite had been known for Neptune, a large one named Triton. Now Kuiper detected a much smaller one, which he called Nereid. It circled Neptune in the most eccentric orbit of any known satellite.		
atomic-clock	1949	Atomic clock	The atomic clock was created using molecular vibration for timekeeping, achieving incredible precision. It marked a significant advance in measuring time to within a trillionth of a second.	Harold Lyons	United States	pendulum-clock	Science: Physics	In 1949 the American physicist Harold Lyons was the first to harness this molecular vibration to time-keeping purposes. It was the first atomic clock. As atomic clocks of ever-greater precision were devised, physicists could eventually time events to a millionth of a trillionth of a second.		
berkelium-and-californium	1949	Berkelium and californium	Elements berkelium and californium were produced as the most complex atoms of the time. These discoveries contributed to nuclear chemistry and expanded the periodic table.	Glenn Theodore Seaborg	United States	americium-and-curium	Science: Chemistry	In 1949 the more complex elements 97 and 98 were produced. Since this was done at the University of California in Berkeley, California, element 97 was named berkelium and 98 was named californium.		
soviet-fission-bomb	1949	Soviet fission bomb	The Soviet Union successfully detonated its first nuclear fission bomb, ending American monopoly on atomic weapons. This event marked the beginning of nuclear arms race with two superpowers.	Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov	Soviet Union	nuclear-fission	War	The Soviets had been working on fission bombs for years, however, and were clever enough to gain knowledge of some of the American techniques. On September 22, 1949, the Soviets exploded their first fission bomb, and Americans were jarred out of their complacency.		
sickle-cell-anemia	1949	Sickle-cell anemia	The genetic cause of sickle-cell anemia was identified, showing its link to the defective gene on chromosomes. This discovery highlighted the disease's genetic resistance to malaria.	Linus Pauling	United States	malaria, dna-as-genetic-material	Science: Biology	It seemed clearly to be a genetic disease, and in 1949 Linus Pauling was able to show that a defective gene produced the abnormal hemoglobin. With a defective gene on each of a chromosome pair, however, the carriers had sickle-cell anemia itself.		
embryonic-immunological-tolerance	1949	Embryonic immunological tolerance	It was discovered that embryos might not reject foreign proteins, making tissue transplantation easier. This finding led to advancements in reducing tissue transplantation difficulties.	Peter Brian Medawar	England	tissue-transplantation	Science: Biology	Snell had shown the genetic basis of the intolerance for foreign proteins that made tissue transplantation difficult. It occurred to an English anatomist, Peter Brian Medawar, that embryos might not yet have developed an immunological system capable of rejecting foreign proteins. And in fact, when he inoculated mice embryos with tissue cells from another strain, he found that rejection did not take place. Furthermore, when such embryos entered independent life and could form antibodies, they no longer treated cells from the other strain as foreign proteins. By 1949 Medawar had shown how this technique might lead to reducing the difficulties of tissue transplantation. For this he received a share of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1960.		
essential-amino-acids	1949	Essential amino acids	Eight amino acids were found to be essential in human diets as they cannot be synthesized by the body. This discovery improved understanding of nutritional requirements.	William Cumming Rose	United States	asparagine	Science: Biology	Since the first amino acid had been discovered, some twenty amino acids that occur commonly in protein molecules had been identified. The last of these was threonine, isolated in 1935 by the American biochemist William Cumming Rose. Rose's dietary experiments showed that some amino acids could be manufactured in the human body from other amino acids, but some could not and had to be present as such in the diet. All the amino acids are essential to the body structure, but eight of them are essential in the diet, where human beings are concerned, and it is these eight that are considered the essential amino acids. This was definitely established by Rose in 1949.		
cometary-structure	1949	Cometary structure	Comets were proposed to be 'dirty snowballs,' primarily composed of ice and dust that vaporizes near the Sun, forming a coma and tail. This model became widely accepted in understanding cometary composition.	Fred Lawrence Whipple	United States	comet-orbits, silicon	Space	The approach of a comet to the Sun results in the development of a hazy coma and a tail. The American astronomer Fred Lawrence Whipple suggested in 1949 that this could be explained by supposing that comets were essentially icy in nature, made up of an admixture of silicate dust and gravel (and in some cases perhaps, a small rocky core). When heated by the Sun’s closeness, cometary ice vaporized explosively, and the dust it contained formed the haze and the tail. In short, a comet is a 'dirty snowball.' This suggestion was readily adopted by most astronomers, and few, if any, doubt it now.		
cometary-cloud	1950	Cometary cloud	The theory posits a vast spherical cloud of icy comets surrounding the solar system up to 2 light-years away. This would explain the continued presence of comets despite their short-lived appearances near the sun.	Jan Hendrik Oort	Netherlands	comet-orbits	Space	It had been clear for at least a century that comets were comparatively short-lived phenomena. At every approach to the Sun, a substantial quantity of a comet's mass must evaporate, never to return (assuming it to be a "dirty snowball"—see 1949). Even a large comet could only endure a few thousand returns to the neighborhood of the Sun, and some comets had actually been seen to fragment on their passage past the Sun. Why then were not all comets long since gone? It seemed to the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort (b. 1900) that a vast reservoir of them must exist. In 1950 he suggested that a huge spherical cloud of icy comets, perhaps a hundred billion of them altogether, must exist within an area 1 to 2 light-years from the Sun. They might represent the outermost material from the original nebula, left behind by the condensation of the inner material into the Sun and the planets 4.6 billion years ago and unchanged ever since. Every once in a while, collisions or the gravitational pull of one of the nearer stars might alter rotational velocities and allow a comet to fall into the inner Solar System, where observers on Earth could see it. Oort estimated that perhaps 20 percent of the original cloud had thus been hurled inward (or outward into interstellar space), but an ample number remained to supply more comets for the indefinite future. No direct evidence of this cometary cloud (sometimes called the Oort cloud) exists, but the notion is accepted by most astronomers.		
plutos-diameter	1950	Pluto's diameter	Kuiper determined that Pluto's diameter is less than 3,600 miles, revealing it to be smaller than Mars. This discovery indicated Pluto could not cause the perturbation of Uranus, suggesting sheer coincidence in its location.	Gerard Kuiper	England	pluto	Space	In 1950, Kuiper, the discoverer of Miranda, managed to see Pluto as a disk and to measure its apparent width. He showed that its diameter could not be more than 3,600 miles, which made it smaller than Mars and explained its dimness. If Pluto was as small as this, it could not be the source of the perturbation of Uranus, and it must have been located in the right spot by sheer coincidence.		
turing-machine	1950	Turing machine	Turing demonstrated a simple machine that could theoretically solve any mathematically formulated problem, suggesting the existence of artificial intelligence. He proposed a test for AI, where a machine's indistinguishable conversation from a human's would demonstrate intelligence.	Alan Mathison Turing	England	computer	Science: Mathematics	In 1950, Turing showed that, in principle, a very simple machine capable of an astonishingly few moves could solve any problem capable of being formulated in mathematical terms. This Turing machine went a long way toward convincing workers in the field that something one might call artificial intelligence could exist. Turing also pointed out how one could decide whether artificial intelligence had been achieved: if one could carry on a conversation with some hidden entity without being able to demonstrate from the conversation alone whether that entity was a human being or not, and if that entity was a machine, it displayed artificial intelligence.		
game-playing-computers	1950	Game-playing computers	Shannon proposed a method for creating chess-playing computers (after Arthur L. Samuel's checkers in 1947), leading to machines capable of playing high-level chess games. This innovation expanded computers' abilities beyond simple calculations into strategic gameplay.	Claude Shannon and Arthur Samuel	United States	computer	Science: Computing	In 1950, the American mathematician Claude Elwood Shannon suggested ways to design a chess-playing computer, and such machines have since been built and play excellent games of chess. Indeed, it is not beyond the limits of probability that such a machine might become the world’s chess champion. Such devices further explored the capability of computers beyond basic calculation.		
endoplasmic-reticulum	1950	Endoplasmic reticulum	The electron microscope allowed detailed study of cells, leading to the discovery of the endoplasmic reticulum. This structure provides support within the cell, holding organelles in place.	Albert Claude	Belgium	electron-microscope-improved	Science: Biology	The invention of the electron microscope made it possible to study the cell in far greater detail than ever before. An early expert in cellular electron microscopy was the Belgian cytologist Albert Claude who discovered the endoplasmic reticulum, which serves as the structural background of the cell holding organelles in place.		
carbon-14-tracer	1950	Carbon-14 tracer	Carbon-14 was used successfully as a radioactive tracer to study molecular changes in the body. Its application helped explain cholesterol formation.	Konrad Emil Bloch	United States	coenzyme-a, isotopic-tracers	Science: Chemistry	Carbon-14 had first found a useful scientific purpose when applied as a dating technique. By 1950, it had been obtained in sufficient quantity to be useful as a radioactive tracer. Biochemist Konrad Emil Bloch used it to show how the cholesterol molecule builds up in the body from the acetyl group.		
breeder-reactors	1951	Breeder reactors	Breeder reactors utilize uranium-238 to create fissionable plutonium. This process allows for more efficient use of uranium by generating additional fuel.			nuclear-reactor	Science: Nuclear	The nuclear reactors built during the first decade of the atomic age depended on the fission of uranium-235. This is a relatively rare isotope of uranium, making up only 0.7 percent of the whole. Then it was discovered that if such reactors were built with ordinary uranium-238 in a jacket around the core, enough neutrons could be made to stream into the uranium-238 to form plutonium atoms, which are fissionable.		
stellarator	1951	Stellarator	The stellarator is a figure-8 shaped device designed to confine hot hydrogen using a magnetic field to allow controlled nuclear fusion as a source of peaceful energy. This invention aimed to harness the vast energy of nuclear fusion, which far exceeds that of fission. It was not successful.	Lyman Spitzer, Jr.	United States	nuclear-reactor	Science: Physics	In 1951 the American physicist Lyman Spitzer, Jr. (b. 1914) supervised the construction of a figure-8 device called a stellarator.		
hydrogen-radiation	1951	Hydrogen radiation	Radio emissions from hydrogen atoms in space were detected, allowing for the identification of atoms and molecules across interstellar space. This discovery provided a method to study the universe using radio waves and their specific emissions.	Edward Mills Purcell	United States	radio-waves-from-hydrogen, nuclear-magnetic-resonance	Space	In 1951 Purcell, who had earlier helped work out the theory of nuclear magnetic resonance, actually detected this radiation coming from outer space. This demonstrated the value of radio waves in detecting the presence of given atoms and molecules in interstellar space. The wavelengths of the radiation emitted were characteristic of different substances and acted as 'fingerprints.'		
milky-way-structure	1951	Milky way structure	The spiral structure of the Milky Way was deduced using radio wave emissions of ionized hydrogen. This discovery identified our galaxy as having a spiral structure, similar to the Andromeda Galaxy.	William Wilson Morgan	United States	spiral-nebulas, andromeda-nebula	Space	By 1951, astronomers could detect radio wave emissions and the American astronomer William Wilson Morgan could make out the characteristic radio waves of ionized hydrogen coming from particularly hot, bright stars that were themselves characteristic of the spiral arms of galaxies. When several such lines of ionized hydrogen were found coming from our galaxy, it seemed convincing evidence that the Milky Way Galaxy had spiral arms.		
jupiter-xii	1951	Jupiter XII	A new satellite of Jupiter, Jupiter XII, was discovered, adding to the known count of the planet's moons. It was only 20 miles in diameter.	Seth Barnes Nicholson	United States	jupiter-ix	Space	Seth Nicholson, who over a period of nearly four decades had discovered three of the small outer satellites of Jupiter, in 1951 discovered a fourth. This was the twelfth satellite of Jupiter to be detected and was therefore referred to as Jupiter XII.		
superconductivity-theory	1951	Superconductivity theory	A theoretical explanation for superconductivity using quantum mechanics was developed. This theory advanced understanding of how certain materials can conduct electricity with no resistance at very low temperatures.	John Bardeen	United States	superconductivity	Science: Physics	In 1951 John Bardeen worked out a theoretical consideration of the phenomenon, making use of quantum effects, that seemed to explain a good deal. It was good enough, in fact, for Bardeen to be awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1972.		
univac	1951	UNIVAC	UNIVAC was the first computer to use magnetic tape and be mass-produced. It marked the start of widespread computer use in industry.	John William Mauchly and John Presper Eckart Jr	England	eniac	Design	Mauchly and Eckert, who had designed ENIAC, designed UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) in 1951. It was the first computer to make use of magnetic tape and the first to be mass-produced rather than individually built by the designers for their own use. It marked the beginning, then, of computers in industry.		
steroid-synthesis	1951	Steroid synthesis	The synthesis of cholesterol and cortisone was achieved, marking a significant advancement in organic chemistry. These were both steroids with a unique four-ring structure.	Robert Burns Woodward	England	synthesis-of-quinine	Science: Chemistry	Woodward, who had made it his business to synthesize the most complex of naturally occurring organic molecules, achieved the synthesis of cholesterol and cortisone in 1951. These were both steroids, with molecules possessing a characteristic four-ring structure.		
acetylcoenzyme-a	1951	Acetylcoenzyme A	Acetylcoenzyme A was isolated for the first time in 1951, highlighting its role in metabolism of fats. This discovery significantly advanced understanding of biochemical processes.	Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen	Germany	coenzyme-a, carbon-14-tracer	Science: Biology	Lipmann had demonstrated the existence of coenzyme A as the carrier of the acetyl group. In 1951 the German biochemist Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen studied the function of coenzyme A in the metabolism of fat molecules particularly. He was the first to isolate acetylcoenzyme A, the compound that acts as intermediary in the transference of the acetyl group from one compound to another.		
fluoridation	1951	Fluoridation	Fluoridation of water supplies began as a project to reduce tooth decay. It was observed that regions with higher fluoride levels in water had lower incidences of caries.		United States	dentistry	Science: Health	The most common disease afflicting mankind is caries, more commonly known as tooth decay. Prevention, however, is better than cure, and dentists noticed that people in certain areas in the United States rarely got caries. By 1951, projects for the careful fluoridation of water supplies were in progress, in the hope that this (and the use of fluoridated toothpaste) would substantially reduce the incidence of tooth decay.		
nuclear-fusion-bomb	1952	Nuclear fusion bomb	The U.S. successfully tested a nuclear fusion bomb, a significant advancement in nuclear weapon technology. It demonstrated a massive explosive power far beyond previous atomic bombs, but the Soviets had their own within a year.	Edward Teller	United States	nuclear-fission-bomb, stellarator	War	The American effort to produce a nuclear fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb) was soon successful. Hydrogen-2 fused at a lower temperature than hydrogen-1, and hydrogen-3 fused at a lower temperature still. Hydrogen-2 was a rare isotope of hydrogen, but there was enough present in the Earth’s oceans to last humanity for billions of years. Hydrogen-3 was radioactive and had to be formed through nuclear reactions if enough was to be obtained for use. It was planned to fuse a mixture of hydrogen-2 and hydrogen-3 in liquid form by exposure to the temperatures and pressures produced by a fission bomb. Such a fusion bomb was tested on a coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean on November 1, 1952, wiping out the atoll. The blast yielded energy equivalent to 10,000,000 tons (10 megatons) of TNT—five hundred times the 20-kiloton energy of the Hiroshima bomb.		
einsteinium-and-fermium	1952	Einsteinium and Fermium	New elements einsteinium and fermium were discovered during the study of the aftermath of a hydrogen bomb test. This highlighted advancements in chemistry, providing insight into the creation of complex atoms.	Glenn Theodore Seaborg	United States	berkelium-and-californium	Science: Chemistry	Seaborg (see 1940 and 1944) and his team continued to make ever more complex atoms, and as the atoms were made, they were bombarded with small atomic nuclei. Some of these stuck to the complex nucleus of the atoms being bombarded so that still newer and more complex atoms were formed. In 1952, however, complex atoms were formed in a different way. The ravening energies of the fusion bomb explosion in the Pacific (see above) had driven nuclei together and formed atoms even more complex than californium (element number 98), which was at the time the most complex known (see 1949). As a result, elements 99 and 100 were formed and detected. They were eventually named, respectively, einsteinium and fermium in honor of Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, who had died in the months preceding laboratory study of the elements.		
kaons-and-hyperons	1952	Kaons and Hyperons	New particles called kaons were discovered, about 3.5 times as massive as a pion but still only half as massive as a proton or neutron and was called a K-meson, which was sometimes abbreviated to kaon. Additional newly discovered particles heavier than kaons were termed hyperons.	Marian Danysz, Jerzy Pniewski	Poland	pion	Science: Physics	Pions had been discovered by Powell (see 1947), and since that was the intermediate-sized particle that Yukawa had predicted (see 1935, Strong Interaction), there seemed no reason to expect anything more. In 1952, however, two Polish physicists, Marian Danysz and Jerzy Pniewski, discovered another intermediate-sized particle. It was about 3.5 times as massive as a pion but still only half as massive as a proton or neutron and was called a K-meson, which was sometimes abbreviated to kaon. These same physicists went on that year to discover, among the products of cosmic rays, a series of particles even heavier than kaons and these were termed hyperons.		
origin-of-life-experiment	1952	Origin of life experiment	An experiment recreated early Earth conditions: a core of nickel-iron, surrounded by a rocky mantle and crust, topped by an ocean of water and an atmosphere of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. This led to the formation of organic compounds spontaneously and provided insight into possible origins of life on Earth.	Stanley Lloyd Miller	United States	origin-of-life	Science: Biology	In 1952, Stanley Lloyd Miller conducted an experiment with Harold Urey to simulate early Earth conditions. They used a mix of gases like hydrogen, ammonia, and methane, with electric discharge to create organic compounds, simulating a possible way life on Earth began.		
x-ray-diffraction-of-dna	1952	X-ray diffraction of DNA	X-ray diffraction studies revealed DNA's helical structure, with the phosphate groups that bound the units together located on the outside of the helix.	Rosalind Elsie Franklin	England	nucleic-acid-base-balance, ions-and-crystals	Science: Biology	In 1952 the English biophysicist Rosalind Elsie Franklin made careful X-ray diffraction studies of DNA, from which she deduced that the molecule ought to be helical (like a spiral staircase).		
insulin-structure	1952	Insulin structure	Painstaking research using paper chromatography determined the amino acid order in insulin. This breakthrough enhanced understanding of protein structures.	Frederick Sanger	England	paper-chromatography	Science: Biology	A British biochemist, Frederick Sanger, used a painstaking method and, by 1952, could show that the molecule of the protein hormone insulin consisted of some fifty amino acids distributed among two interconnected chains.		
virus-transduction	1952	Virus transduction	When bacteriophages attacked, their DNA entered the cell and supervised formation of new virus components. This process called transduction enabled transfers of genetic material between cells, opening possibilities for genetic engineering	Alfred Hershey and Joshua Lederberg	United States	dna-as-genetic-material, virus-nucleic-acid	Science: Biology	In 1952 Alfred Hershey showed that when bacteriophages attacked the bacterial cells that were its natural prey, it was the DNA that actually entered.		
radioimmune-assay	1952	Radioimmune assay	The radioimmune assay method enables the detection of antibodies and substances in the body through radioactive tracing. This is a highly sensitive method of measuring very low concentrations of proteins.	Rosalyn Sussman Yalow	United States	carbon-14-tracer	Science: Medicine	By 1952, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow devised a precise method for detecting antibodies and biologically active substances using a radioactive substance. This technique, radioimmune assay, allowed for significant medical diagnostics by detecting minute quantities of these substances in the body.		
rem-sleep	1952	REM sleep	REM sleep involves periods of heightened physiological activity (eye movement, breathing, heart rate, blood pressure), often linked to dreaming. This discovery revealed critical aspects of sleep cycles and their impact on mental health. The function of REM sleep and dreaming remains a matter of dispute.	William Charles Dement	United States	dreams	Science: Psychology	In 1952, William Charles Dement discovered that during REM sleep, conditions such as eye movement, breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure reach waking levels, often coinciding with dreams. REM sleep was found to constitute about a quarter of total sleep time.		
tranquilizers	1952	Tranquilizers	Tranquilizers, such as reserpine, were developed to calm patients without diminishing alertness which was a side effect of barbituates. They gained popularity for psychiatric treatment, reducing the need for harsh restraints.	Robert Wallace Wilkins	United States	barbiturates	Science: Medicine	Sedatives are obviously useful for quieting overexcited states and for inducing calm. The best-known sedatives prior to the 1950s were the barbiturates, but they diminished alertness and produced sleep. In 1952 the American physician Robert Wallace Wilkins (b. 1906) studied a drug, reserpine, obtained from the root of an Indian shrub. He reported that it had a sedative effect without diminishing alertness or inducing sleep. Reserpine and other drugs of its nature came to be called tranquilizers. They grew instantly popular with many people for use in the reduction (real or fancied) of tensions (real or fancied). They served, more seriously, as adjuncts to psychiatric treatment, for although they are in no sense a cure for any mental disease, they do calm violent patients without the use of harsh physical restraints, and calm patients may then more easily cooperate with the psychiatrist.		
gas-chromatography	1952	Gas chromatography	Gas chromatography separates gas mixtures efficiently, aiding in the detection of trace impurities. This advancement enhances the accuracy and speed of analytical chemistry processes.	A. J. P. Martin	England	paper-chromatography	Science: Chemistry	In 1952 A. J. P. Martin, who had helped evolve the technique of paper chromatography (see 1944), applied its principles to the separation of gases. In his new technique, mixtures of gases or vapors were passed through a liquid solvent or over an adsorbing solid (that is, one to which gas molecules tend to cling) by means of a current of inert carrier gas, such as nitrogen or helium. The components of the gas mixture were pushed along with the carrier gas at different speeds, so that the carrier arrived at the other end with the components of the gas mixture separated. Such gas chromatography is particularly useful because of the speed of its separations and the great delicacy with which it can detect trace impurities.		
zone-refining	1952	Zone refining	Zone refining purifies materials by melting and drawing impurities to one end, and then removing it. This technique is crucial for producing pure materials used in electronics.	William Gardner Pfann	United States	ions-and-crystals	Science: Materials	The American chemist William Gardner Pfann introduced the technique of zone refining in 1952. This calls for a rod, of germanium or silicon, for instance, placed within a circular heating element. The section of the rod that is enclosed softens and begins to melt, and as the rod is drawn through the hollow, the softened zone moves along its length. Any impurities in the rod tend to remain in the softened zone, so that they are washed to the end of the rod. After a few passes of this sort, the end can be cut off and what remains is unprecedentedly pure. This is a most useful technique in preparing pure material that can then be "doped" with trace quantities of deliberately chosen impurities in concentrations suitable for solid-state electronic devices such as computers.		
the-double-helix	1953	The double helix	DNA was imagined as two chains of nucleotides forming a double helix. Each adenine bound to a thymine, a guanine bound to a cytosine. The double helix structure allowed replication without structural changes.	Francis Harry Compton Crick and James Dewey Watson	England	nucleic-acid-base-balance, x-ray-diffraction-of-dna	Science: Biology	The work of Chargaff and Franklin supplied the information necessary to work out the structure of DNA. The key conceptual step was taken by Francis Harry Compton Crick and James Dewey Watson. They used an X-ray diffraction photograph taken by Franklin, made available by Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins. Watson and Crick suggested that DNA consisted of two chains of nucleotides arranged as a double helix, with the purine and pyrimidine bases facing each other and the phosphate links on the outside. Each two-ringed purine faced a one-ringed pyrimidine, so that the space between the two strands was constant. Adenines and thymines were paired, as were guanines and cytosines. DNA is the principal component of chromosomes, found in the nuclei of all cells.		
isotactic-polymers	1953	Isotactic polymers	Polymers had been increasingly useful but manufactured out of simpler units, which sometimes with branches in the chain. Isotactic polymers all have just one chain and all sub-components face the same way. Polyethylene was tougher, and higher melting than the old. 	Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta	Germany and Italy	bakelite	Science: Chemistry	In 1953, the Italian chemist Giulio Natta (1903–1979) discovered a method to organize polymer units such that the side groups of a unit would all point in the same direction. This was achieved by resulting in isotactic polymers, which had improved properties.		
plate-tectonics	1953	Plate tectonics	The discovery of the Great Global Rift in the mid-Atlantic ocean highlighted the existence of tectonic plates. Plate tectonics explains the structure of Earth's outer shell and the movement of large plates that cause earthquakes and volcanoes.	Maurice Ewing, Bruce Charles Heezen	United States	continental-drift, mohorovicic-discontinuity	Science: Geography	In 1953, American physicists Maurice Ewing (1906–1974) and Bruce Charles Heezen (1924–1977) discovered a deep canyon running the length of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge, known as the Great Global Rift. The study revealed that the Earth's crust is divided into large plates called tectonic plates.		
bubble-chambers	1953	Bubble chambers	The bubble chamber, allows visualization of subatomic particle paths using bubbles in liquid. This innovation greatly enhanced particle physics research and earned Glaser a Nobel Prize.	Donald Arthur Glaser	United States	cloud-chamber	Science: Physics	At this time the most familiar device for detecting the paths of subatomic particles was the cloud chamber invented by Wilson (see 1911). The American physicist Donald Arthur Glaser (b. 1926) thought of reversing its principle. In the cloud chamber, you have humid air on the point of forming small droplets of liquid. What if you started, instead, with a liquid that was on the point of boiling and forming small bubbles of vapor? In the cloud chamber, a speeding charged particle would encourage the formation of droplets, and a line of droplets would mark out its path. In this new bubble chamber, a speeding charged particle would encourage the formation of bubbles, and a line of bubbles would mark out its path. Since liquids are denser than gases, a speeding particle will slow more quickly in a bubble chamber than in a cloud chamber, curve more intensely, and reveal its properties more clearly. Then, too, there will be more collisions in the bubble chamber—more events will take place. Finally, if liquid hydrogen is used as the liquid, it will consist, for the most part, of electrons and single protons, and the simplicity of the background will make the results easier to interpret. By 1953 Glaser had made his bubble chamber a practical reality and they have been an indispensable tool of subatomic investigations ever since. Glaser received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1960 as a result.		
strange-particles	1953	Strange particles	Strange particles, like kaons and hyperons, exhibit unique decay behavior and are governed by a property called strangeness. This discovery helped refine the understanding of subatomic particle interactions.	Murray Gell-Mann	United States	kaons-and-hyperons, quantum-electrodynamics	Science: Physics	Kaons and hyperons are subject to the strong interaction and are formed in ways that involve the strong interaction. It would seem that they ought to break down by the strong interaction too, but they don’t; they break down far more slowly by way of the weak interaction. This is not to say that they break down slowly in any absolute sense—it takes just under a billionth of a second—but if they broke down by way of the strong reaction, it would only take a billionth of a billionth of a second. That they break down so slowly seemed strange, and they came to be called strange particles. In 1953 the American physicist Murray Gell-Mann (b. 1929) tried to make sense out of this strangeness. He studied the properties of groups of two or three hadrons that differed only in the nature of their electric charge and assigned each group a kind of average electric charge. In this way he was able to demonstrate that each group had a special property, which he called strangeness, that depended on the properties of the average electric charge. In the most familiar hadrons, such as the proton, neutron, and pion, the strangeness number was 0 and the property was negligible. For kaons and hyperons, however, the strangeness number was not 0 but +1, -1, +2, or -2.		
masers	1953	Masers	Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (MASER) devices work by inducing atoms into an excited energy state. As Einstein predicted, once in that state they can amplify radiation at a frequency particular to the element or molecule used as the masing medium. Technically the Soviets came first.	Charles Hard Townes, Nikolay Basov, and Alexander Prokhorov	United States and Russia	radar, photoelectric-effect-and-quanta	Science: Physics	By December 1953, Townes had a device that actually worked in this fashion. The process was described by the phrase microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Using the initials of the phrase, the instrument was referred to more briefly as a maser.		
heart-lung-machine	1953	Heart-lung machine	The heart-lung machine facilitates open-heart surgeries by replacing the heart and lungs' functions temporarily. It has significantly improved coronary bypass operations, saving many lives.	John G. Gibbon	United States	perfusion-pump, blood-circulation	Science: Medicine	A heart-lung machine (or pump oxygenator) is one that takes venous blood from the veins, oxygenates it by mixing it with air, and pumps it back into the arteries, thus bypassing lungs and heart. It makes it possible to stop the heart and perform open-heart surgery without endangering the patient's life. The first successful heart-lung machine, devised by John G. Gibbon of the United States, was used in 1953.		
transistorization	1953	Transistorization	Early transistors were not reliable, but this quickly changed, and by 1953 the first significant transistorized instruments for use by the general public were introduced. The world was about to enter an age of miniaturization.		United States	transistor, zone-refining	Science: Technology	The transistor had been invented by Shockley and his group (see 1948), but its performance was at first unreli...		
spray-cans	1953	Spray cans	Spray cans became cheaply producible due to a new valve mechanism, leading to widespread use. This contributed to environmental concerns due to Freon emissions.	Robert H. Abplanalp	United States	freon, celluloid	Design	In 1953 a new plastic valve mechanism was designed by the American inventor Robert H. Abplanalp (b. 1923), which made it possible to produce an aluminum spray can cheaply. The spray could be ejected by evaporating Freon (see 1930), which was a liquid that evaporated easily and did not produce high pressures. As a result, there was a vast multiplication of spray cans and an enormous discharge of Freon vapors into the atmosphere.		
salk-vaccine	1954	Salk vaccine	Jonas Salk developed an injected vaccine for polio by killing the virus to stimulate immunity without causing disease. This breakthrough significantly improved public health by controlling polio outbreaks.	Jonas Edward Salk	United States	vaccination, virus-culture	Science: Biology	Poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) was a particularly frightening disease, because when it did not kill, it often paralyzed permanently, leaving people in wheelchairs or even iron lungs. Once the polio virus could be cultured in chick embryos, however, as shown by Enders and his group (see 1948), it was possible to experiment with it. Thus the American microbiologist Jonas Edward Salk (b. 1914) tried to kill the virus, so that it would not give rise to the disease, but to leave it sufficiently intact that it would stimulate the growth of antibodies and lead to immunity.		
kidney-transplant	1954	Kidney transplant	The first successful kidney transplant was performed in Boston between identical twins. This milestone paved the way for future organ transplants, saving numerous lives.		United States	embryonic-immunological-tolerance	Science: Medicine	The first successful kidney transplant took place in December 1954 in Boston, from one identical twin to another. Since identical twins have the same genetic makeup, they have very little tendency to reject each other's organs.		
controlled-fission-reactors	1954	Controlled fission reactors	The first nuclear reactor for civilian electric power was activated in the Soviet Union, followed by larger ones in other countries. This innovation significantly contributed to global energy supplies through nuclear power, and similar reactors were used in nuclear submarines.		Soviet Union	nuclear-reactor	Science: Nuclear Physics	The first nuclear reactor built to produce electric power for civilian use was put into action in the Soviet Union in June 1954. Larger reactors were produced in Great Britain and the United States soon after, which began to contribute substantially to the world’s energy supply.		
oxytocin-synthesis	1954	Oxytocin synthesis	Oxytocin was synthesized for the first time, showing identical properties to the natural protein. This was the first time a naturally occurring protein was synthesized by constructing it out of the correct amino acid chain.	Vincent du Vigneaud	United States	insulin-structure, steroid-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	At about the time that Sanger was working out the order of amino acids in the protein chains of the insulin molecule (see 1952), Vincent du Vigneaud (see 1942) was determining the exact makeup of the hormone oxytocin, produced by the posterior portion of the pituitary gland. Oxytocin was a particularly simple protein hormone, its molecules made up of only eight amino acid residues arranged in a circle. Du Vigneaud went on in 1954 to synthesize oxytocin, combining just the right amino acids in the right order. This was the first occasion on which a naturally occurring protein was synthesized and the synthetic protein shown to have just the same properties and abilities as the protein as it occurs in the body. For this, du Vigneaud was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1955.		
chloroplast-isolation	1954	Chloroplast isolation	Intact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves, enabling photosynthesis outside the cell environment. This discovery furthered understanding of photosynthesis and cellular processes in plants.	Daniel Israel Arnon	United States	chloroplasts	Science: Biology	Since Pelletier and Caventou had isolated chlorophyll (see 1817), it had been well known that chlorophyll was essential to photosynthesis. However, no one had been able to make chlorophyll perform the task in the test-tube. It had been nearly a century since von Sachs had discovered that chlorophyll was present in discrete organelles, called chloroplasts, within the plant cell (see 1862). It was natural to assume that in the cell, chlorophyll worked as a catalyst, not by itself but as part of an intricate system that was present intact in the chloroplast. This could be shown if chloroplasts could be isolated intact from the cells, and made to show that they could then carry out photosynthesis in the test-tube. But chloroplasts are so flimsy that for a long time no procedure sufficed to extract them intact. Finally in 1954 the Polish-American biochemist Daniel Israel Arnon (b. 1910) was able to obtain intact chloroplasts from disrupted spinach-leaf cells and demonstrate their ability to carry on photosynthesis outside the cell.		
strychnine-synthesis	1954	Strychnine synthesis	Strychnine, a complex and poisonous alkaloid with seven connected rings, was synthesized. This synthesis showcased advancements in complex organic chemistry.	Robert Burns Woodward	United States	steroid-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	In 1954 that master-synthetist Woodward (see 1944, Synthesis of Quinine) managed to synthesize the fearfully complicated (and poisonous) alkaloid strychnine, which had a molecule built up of seven intricately related rings of atoms.		
genetic-code-theory	1954	Genetic code	By now it was known that there were at least twenty amino acids, and if the DNA mapped to them in some way using just the four nucleotides, there must be some encoding scheme. Gamow proposed a scheme triplets allow to encode 4^3 = 64 amino acids.	George Gamow	United States	essential-amino-acids, the-double-helix	Science: Biology	Granted that DNA contained the information that governed the inheritance of characteristics, it must do this by overseeing the manufacture of enzymes, which in turn controlled the chemical reactions that went on inside cells. But how could DNA turn the trick? It was composed of chains of four different nucleotides, while enzymes, which were proteins, were composed of chains of twenty different amino acids. In 1954 George Gamow (see 1929) suggested that it made no sense to try to line up an individual nucleotide with an individual amino acid.		
photovoltaic-cells	1954	Photovoltaic cells	Using the insight that selenium conducts current more easily in the light than in the dark, photovoltaic cells were invented to convert sunlight into electricity by using semiconductors to create a current from light-excited electrons. 	Fuller, Chapin and Pearson	England	chloroplasts, photoelectric-effect-and-quanta, cadmium-lithium-selenium	Science: Energy	Selenium was known to conduct electric current more easily in the light than in the dark. It was eventually realized that sunlight could knock electrons loose from selenium atoms, creating a current. By 1954, photovoltaic cells using semiconductors similar to those in transistors were developed, enabling the conversion of about 4 percent of sunlight into electricity. These cells became known as solar batteries, eventually achieving efficiencies of up to 30 percent.		
robots	1954	Robots	The word "robot" was first coined in a Czech playwright in 1920. This first real patent laid the groundwork for industrial robots, eventually turning into Unimate, which worked on a General Motors assembly line.	George C. Devol, Jr.	United States	cybernetics	General	Although robots were much used in science fiction, the first patent wasn’t taken on a robotic device in real life until 1954. It was the work of the American inventor George C. Devol, Jr., who teamed up afterward with the American entrepreneur Joseph F. Engelberger (b. 1925), who had grown interested in robots as a result of reading I, Robot by Isaac Asimov (b. 1920). For twenty years they continued to develop patents, but the manufacture of robots that were sufficiently cheap and compact to be used in industry had to await further advances in computers.		
bevatron	1954	Bevatron	UC Berkeley's Bevatron, named after its power (5 billion electron volts, or BeV) and not to be confused with the beTatron, was capable of producing enough energy to replicate intense cosmic rays. 		United States	particle-accelerator, cyclotron	Science: Physics	Since the first particle accelerator was built by Cockcroft and Walton (see 1929), the energy produced by particle accelerators had increased enormously. By 1954, a particle accelerator capable of accelerating protons to an energy of 5 to 6 billion electron volts (BeV) had been built at the University of California. It was called the Bevatron because of the energy range of the particles it produced, and indeed it could produce particles in the energy range of fairly intense cosmic rays. This meant it was no longer necessary to wait for cosmic rays to strike atoms in the atmosphere and produce interesting results, as Anderson had had to (see 1932). The necessary bombarding particles were always there, and in any reasonable quantities. The search could proceed much more surely in the laboratory, especially since particle accelerators continued to be made ever more powerful as time went on.		
oral-contraceptives	1954	Oral contraceptives	A hormone-based oral contraceptive was developed and tested, leading to the creation of 'the Pill'. This innovation enabled birth control and supported the women's liberation movement.	Gregory Goodwin Pincus	United States	sex-hormones, estrone	Science: Biology	The American biologist Gregory Goodwin Pincus (1903–1967) found such a hormone, and clinical tests in 1954 demonstrated its efficacy. Use of the Pill (as it was popularly termed) made possible sex without fear of pregnancy. This went a long way toward abolishing the double standard and encouraged the women’s liberation movement.		
contact-lenses	1954	Contact lenses	By 1887, Fick had made lenses that could fit directly over the iris of the eye, but glass in direct contact with the eye was uncomfortable and dangerous. Plastic contact lenses were developed, offering a less conspicuous way to correct vision.	Adolf Eugen Fick	Germany	bifocal-lenses, astigmatism	Science: Biology	Glass in direct contact with the eye, however, would be irritating and dangerous. In 1954 plastic contact lenses were produced, which proved useful and popular, and contact lenses are now in common use.		
exploding-galaxies	1955	Exploding galaxies	An unusually strong radio source in Cygnus led to the discovery of galaxies in a state of explosion. This discovery highlighted the dynamic processes in active galaxies releasing enormous energies.	Viktor Amazaspovich Ambartsumian	Russia	radio-telescope	Space	A radio source in Cygnus was unusually strong, and optical investigation of the region revealed a peculiarly shaped galaxy that looked rather like two galaxies undergoing a collision. The Soviet astronomer Viktor Amazaspovich Ambartsumian (b. 1908) examined the nature of the radio source closely and suggested that it was really a galaxy in a state of vast explosion. That idea was borne out by later work.		
birth-of-stars	1955	Birth of stars	The discovery of two new stars in the Orion nebula indicates that star formation is an ongoing process. This provides insight into the lifecycle and birth of stars in the universe.	George Howard Herbig	United States	main-sequence	Space	In 1955 the American astronomer George Howard Herbig (b. 1920) detected two stars in the Orion nebula that had not been seen a few years earlier. This means we may have witnessed the actual birth of these stars.		
jupiters-radio-waves	1955	Jupiter's radio waves	The detection of nonthermal radio waves from Jupiter suggested the presence of charged particles around the planet. This advanced the understanding of planetary magnetic fields and particle dynamics.	Kenneth Linn Franklin	United States	radio-telescope	Space	In 1955 the American astronomer Kenneth Linn Franklin (b. 1923) detected radio waves emanating from the planet Jupiter; they were nonthermal, that is, they were not of the pattern that would be emitted simply because of the temperature of Jupiter's cloud layer. Speculation arose that they were the result of charged particles in motion in the neighborhood of Jupiter, and eventually this was found to be true.		
plutos-rotation	1955	Pluto's rotation	Fluctuations in Pluto's light led to the conclusion that it rotates on its axis once every 6.4 days. This provided new insights into Pluto's rotational behavior and surface characteristics.	Walker and Hardie	United States	pluto	Space	In 1955 its light was seen to fluctuate slightly, with a period of 6.4 days. The obvious conclusion was that Pluto rotated on its axis once every 6.4 days and that one hemisphere reflected somewhat less light than the other.		
antiproton	1955	Antiproton	The antiproton was discovered using the Bevatron, by bombarding copper with high-energy protons, contributing to the understanding of antimatter. This discovery supported the theory of antiparticles and advanced particle physics.	Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain	United States	bevatron, antimatter	Science: Physics	In 1955 Segrè, who had first detected technetium (see 1937), and the American physicist Owen Chamberlain (b. 1920) bombarded copper for hours with protons possessing energies of 6.2 BeV. They worked out an elaborate system for detecting any antiprotons that might be formed, even amid large numbers of other particles of different charge and.		
mendelevium	1955	Mendelevium	Mendelevium was synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with protons. This discovery added a new element to the periodic table.	Glenn Theodore Seaborg	England	einsteinium-and-fermium	Science: Chemistry	In 1955 Seaborg and his group bombarded einsteinium, element number 99, with protons and formed a few atoms of element 101. They named this new element mendelevium, after Mendeleev, who had first worked out the periodic table.		
synthetic-diamonds	1955	Synthetic diamonds	Previous attempts at compressing Coal into diamonds had resulted in the diamond-like mineral Moissanite. But now it was possible to achieve 100,000 atmospheres and 2,500C, enough to synthesize Synthetic diamonds out of graphite.		England	higher-pressure	Science: Chemistry	Bridgman's work made the conversion possible by attaining pressures of 100,000 atmospheres and temperatures of 2,500°C. Using chromium as a catalyst, they formed synthetic diamonds out of graphite, and eventually without a catalyst.		
field-ion-microscopes	1955	Field ion microscopes	Field ion microscopes use ion beams to achieve magnification, allowing individual atoms to be seen and studied. This development greatly advanced the study of materials at the atomic level.	Erwin Wilhelm Mueller	England	field-emission-microscope	Science: Physics	In 1955, Erwin Wilhelm Mueller devised the field ion microscope, which emitted beams of ions rather than electrons to magnify extremely small objects.		
nucleic-acid-formation	1955	Nucleic acid formation	Aztobacter vinelandii, an enzyme capable of forming RNA-like substances was isolated from a bacterium. Soon after, Escherichia coli was discovered which could catalize DNA-like substance from individual nucleotides.	Arthur Kornberg and Severo Ochoa	England	the-double-helix	Science: Biology	In 1955, Severo Ochoa isolated an enzyme from the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii capable of catalyzing the formation of RNA-like substances from individual nucleotides.		
cyanocobalamin-structure	1955	Cyanocobalamin structure	The detailed structure of cyanocobalamin was determined using X-ray diffraction and computational methods. This was the first direct use of a computer to solve a biochemical problem.	Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin	England	cyanocobalamin, x-ray-diffraction-of-dna, computer	Science: Chemistry	British physicist Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin used X-ray diffraction and a computer to determine the complex structure of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), which was four times as massive as penicillin. The structure took years to solve and was completed by 1955, earning her a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964.		
detection-of-the-neutrino	1956	Detection of the neutrino	The neutrino, a nearly undetectable particle proposed to exist two decades earlier, was observed using nuclear fission reactors. More specifically, it's antiparticle the antineutrino was observed, and neutrinos themselves were later detected in solar radiation.	Frederick Reines and Clyde Lorrain Cowan	United States	neutrino, controlled-fission-reactors	Science: Physics	This discovery confirmed the existence of neutrinos, which had no charge, possibly no mass, and little interaction with other particles. Previously thought undetectable, neutrinos were observed thanks to nuclear fission reactions releasing them in large quantities.		
conservation-of-parity	1956	Conservation of parity	The concept of parity conservation was scrutinized, revealing that although parity is conserved in electromagnetism and gravity, it is violated in weak interactions. This realization impacted the understanding of particle physics.	Yang Chen Ning and Lee Tsung-dao	China	conservation-momentum, kaons-and-hyperons	Science: Physics	In 1956 two Chinese physicists, Yang Chen Ning and Lee Tsung-dao, suggested that there was only one kind of kaon, but that since kaons broke down through the weak interaction, and since in the weak interaction parity was not necessarily conserved, then a kaon could break down into either two or three pions indiscriminately. The experiment was performed, and the electrons came out predominantly in one direction.		
antineutron	1956	Antineutron	Antiparticles so far had all different in their charge. Since the proton was positively charged, antiproton would need to be negatively charged. But what could distinguish an uncharged particle? Perhaps it had to do with spin.	Cork, Lambertson, Piccioni, and Wenzel	United States	antiproton, particle-spin	Science: Physics	Once the antiproton was discovered (see 1955), its properties could be studied. If it encountered a proton, the two oppositely propertied particles annihilated each other and their masses were converted into energy in accordance with Einstein's equation (see 1905). If, however, a proton and an antiproton did not actually collide but passed each other closely, they might not undergo annihilation, but the positive charge of the proton and the negative charge of the antiproton might neutralize each other across the small gap, leaving two uncharged particles. One would be the neutron, of course, but the other, as was shown in 1956, would have to be an antineutron.		
continuous-maser	1956	Continuous maser	The continuous maser allowed for simultaneous energy storage and emission using a three-energy level system. This enhanced the efficiency and utility of masers in scientific applications.	Nicolaas Bloembergen	United States	masers	Science: Physics	In the maser, as first developed by Townes (see 1953), the molecules were first raised to a high energy level and then allowed to drop down to a lower level, giving up the excess energy in a flash of coherent microwave radiation. There would then have to be a pause while the molecules were again raised to a higher level. In 1956, however, the Dutch-born American physicist Nicolaas Bloembergen (b. 1920) devised a maser in which energy was on three levels rather than two, so that one of the upper levels could be storing while the other was emitting. For this continuous maser, he received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1981.		
temperature-of-venus	1956	Temperature of venus	Previously thought to be a comfortable environment for humans, it turned out Venus's temperature was higher than expected, far above the boiling point of water. Discovered by studying the dark side of Venus with a radio telescope.	Cornell H. Mayer	United States	radio-telescope	Space	It had long been assumed that Venus, being closer to the Sun than Earth was, would be warmer than Earth.		
ribosomes	1956	Ribosomes	Ribosomes were discovered by studying small bodies in the cell called microsomes. These were found to be rich in RNA and were identified as the site of protein synthesis.	George Emil Palade	United States	electron-microscope-improved, the-double-helix	Science: Biology	Once the microsocopes were turned upon the cell, far greater detail could be made out than had ever been seen before (see 1932). For instance, there were numerous small bodies, which were called microsomes (small bodies), distributed through the cytoplasm of the cell. The Romanian-born American physiologist George Emil Palade (b. 1912) studied them carefully by electron microscope and found they were not merely mitochondrial fragments, as some had thought, but independent bodies with a chemical composition quite different from that of mitochondria. By 1956 Palade had shown that microsomes were rich in RNA (ribonucleic acid), and they were therefore renamed ribosomes. It was quickly realized that the ribosomes were the site of protein manufacture within the cell.		
transfer-rna	1956	Transfer RNA	Transfer RNA molecules were discovered floating in the cytoplasm. They facilitate protein synthesis by aligning amino acids on ribosomes, playing a crucial role in transferring genetic information for protein production.	Mahlon Bush Hoagland	United States	ribosomes	Science: Biology	In 1956 the American biochemist Mahlon Bush Hoagland (b. 1921) discovered relatively small molecules of RNA in the cytoplasm. These came in different varieties, and Hoagland showed that each variety had the capacity to combine with a particular amino acid. At the other end, the RNA molecule could combine with a particular spot on a ribosome. Once the RNA molecules were lined up properly, the amino acids at the other end of each would be lined up properly too and could easily combine to form particular proteins. Since these RNA molecules transferred the information from the ribosomes to the proteins, they were called transfer RNA.		
pituitary-hormones	1956	Pituitary hormones	The structure of pituitary hormones was determined. ACTH, which emits the stress hormone cortisol is made up of a 39 amino acid chain and human growth hormone is made of a 256 amino acid chain.	Choh Hao Li	China	oxytocin-synthesis	Science: Biology	The structure of oxytocin had been worked out by du Vigneaud and that of insulin by Sanger. Choh Hao Li used these methods to tackle the protein hormones from the pituitary gland. In 1956, he showed the structure of ACTH and isolated human growth hormone.		
sputnik	1957	Sputnik	Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth, launched by the Soviet Union. Its launch was a shock to the USA and marked the start of the Space Age and initiated the space race.	Sergei Korolev	Russia	v-two	Space	Sputnik 1, the first satellite, went into orbit on October 4, 1957, marking the beginning of the Space Age. It was launched by the Soviet Union, taking the United States by surprise.		
jodrell-bank	1957	Jodrell Bank	Jodrell Bank Experimental Station constructed the first large radio telescope in England, 250 feet across. It took six years to build and could track Sputnik as it revolved around the earth.	Bernard Lovell	England	radio-telescope	Space	The first really large radio telescope was built at Jodrell Bank Experimental Station in Great Britain. It was 250 feet across and took six years to construct under the leadership of British astronomer Bernard Lovell.		
photosynthesis-details	1957	Photosynthesis details	A detailed scheme of photosynthesis was developed by isolating intermediate products and using techniques like carbon-14 labeling and paper chromatography.	Melvin Calvin	United States	paper-chromatography, carbon-14-dating, chloroplast-isolation	Science: Biology	Progress was slow, but little by little, Calvin and his group discovered and isolated the intermediate products, deduced how they must fit together, and built up a scheme of photosynthesis that made sense. By 1957 the main strokes were filled out with detail, and Calvin was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1961 as a result.		
gibberellins	1957	Gibberellins	First studied in Japan, Gibberellins are plant hormones isolated from the fungus Gibberla, promoting plant growth and differentiation. It wasn't until 1957 that they reached the west and began to be used in agriculture to increase plant size.		Japan		Science: Biology	There are plant hormones that encourage growth, differentiation of tissue, budding, flowering, and so on. One group of these, the gibberellins, had been isolated from a fungus of the genus Gibberella (hence their name). They were studied first in Japan before World War II, but it was not until 1957 that an awareness of the compounds reached the west. Gibberellins are used to increase the size of plants, particularly in the cultivation of grapes.		
interferon	1957	Interferon	Interferon is a protein produced by cells in response to viral infections, possessing antiviral properties. It acts faster than antibodies and plays a vital role in immune response.	Alick Isaacs	England	virus-culture-penicillin, germ-theory-of-disease	Science: Biology	In 1957 a group headed by the British bacteriologist Alick Isaacs showed that, under the stimulus of a virus invasion, cells would liberate a protein with antiviral properties. It would counter not only the virus that stimulated the production but other viruses as well. The protein, produced more quickly than antibodies, was named interferon.		
sabin-vaccine	1957	Sabin vaccine	The Sabin vaccine introduced live, weakened poliovirus strains to stimulate long-lasting antibody production. This oral vaccine provided a more effective alternative to the injected Salk vaccine.	Albert Bruce Sabin	United States	salk-vaccine	Science: Medicine	The Salk vaccine had been proved effective against poliomyelitis (since 1954). However, the Salk vaccine consisted of dead virus that had to be injected, and whose ability to stimulate antibody production might not be long-lasting. The Polish-American microbiologist Albert Bruce Sabin thought it might be possible to find strains of polio that were too feeble to produce the disease even while alive but that would activate antibody formation and continue to do so as long as they remained in the body. Such live strains could be taken by mouth.		
pacemaker	1957	Pacemaker	The patch of cells in the heart which stimulated the heartbeat was well known for decades, and bulky pacemakers worn outside the body had been built before, but this invention marked the first compact pacemaker which could be implanted subcutaneously.	Clarence Walton Lillehei	United States	electrocardiogram, transistorization, heart-lung-machine	Science: Medicine	Then an artificial pacemaker was devised that used a regular electrical pulse to initiate the heartbeat. At first such things were so bulky they had to be carried outside the body. The first pacemaker that was compact enough to be inserted under the skin in the patient's chest was devised in 1957 by the American physician Clarence Walton Lillehei. Pacemakers are now common among the elderly population.		
tunnel-diode	1957	Tunnel diode	The tunnel diode is a semiconductor device that utilizes a tunnel effect to enable electrons to cross insulating barriers. This discovery allowed for ultrasmall and ultrafast switching devices.	Leo Esaki	Japan	transistorization	Science: Physics	The Japanese physicist Leo Esaki (b. 1925) was working with tiny crystal rectifiers (semiconductor diodes) and found, in 1957, that on occasion their resistance decreased with current intensity rather than increasing as expected. This was caused by a tunnel effect, an ability on the part of electrons to penetrate barriers that were perhaps a hundred atoms thick, as though they were tunneling through. Electrons could do this because they had their wave aspects and could be, in their particle aspect, at any part of the wave. If the wave extended for a hundred-atom thickness, the electron could find itself, every once in a while, on the other side of an insulating barrier, even though this would have been thought impossible in classical physical theory. The barrier-crossing electrons could be used for switching purposes, and Esaki tunnel diodes were ultrasmall and ultrafast. For his discovery, Esaki received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1973.		
borazon	1957	Borazon	Borazon is a material formed by compressing and heating boron (element 9) nitride (element 7) under conditions that create diamond. It is almost as hard as diamond but more stable at high temperatures.	Robert H. Wentorf, Jr	United States	synthetic-diamonds	Science: Material Science	A boron atom has one less electron than a carbon atom, while a nitrogen atom has one more electron than a carbon atom. If boron nitride, with a molecule consisting of one atom of boron and one of nitrogen, is heated and compressed under conditions that would form diamond from graphite (see 1955), the boron nitride takes on the diamond configuration too and is then known as borazon. This trick was accomplished in 1957. The electron arrangement in borazon is just as in diamond. The slight asymmetry resulting from the alternation of boron and nitrogen nuclei keeps borazon from being quite as hard as diamond, but borazon is the more useful at high temperatures. At 9000°C diamond will burn and turn into carbon dioxide, but borazon survives unchanged.		
mössbauer-effect	1958	Mössbauer effect	The Mössbauer effect involves the emission of gamma rays by atoms in a crystal without recoil, allowing precise measurements. It has significant applications in physics, particularly in the study of nuclear interactions and precise gamma-ray spectroscopy.	Rudolf Ludwig Mössbauer	Germany	gamma-rays	Science: Physics	Ordinarily, when an atom emits a gamma ray, it recoils. The wavelength of the gamma ray depends in part on the extent of this recoil. Since this varies somewhat from atom to atom, the gamma rays emitted show a spread of wavelength. The German physicist Rudolf Ludwig Mössbauer (b. 1929) studied conditions under which atoms that were part of a crystal would emit a gamma ray in such a way that the recoil would be spread over all the atoms making up the crystal. The recoil is then vanishingly slight, and the gamma ray wavelength shows no spread due to that recoil. As a result, the crystal emits a sharply monochromatic beam of gamma rays, and this, discovered in 1958, is called the Mössbauer effect. Gamma rays emitted in this way by one crystal will be easily absorbed by another crystal of the same type, but if the wavelength varies even slightly in either direction, absorption will not take place. For this work, Mössbauer received a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1961.		
solar-x-rays	1958	Solar X rays	Solar X Rays are emissions from solar flares detected using rocket-borne instruments beyond Earth’s atmosphere. This discovery enhanced understanding of solar energy and confirmed that the Sun’s corona is extremely hot due to individual atomic energies.	Herbert Friedman	United States	liquid-fuel-rockets, x-ray-wavelength	Space	The firing of rockets beyond the atmosphere made it possible to detect X rays coming from astronomical objects. Such X rays could not be detected from Earth's surface, because the Earth's atmosphere absorbed them. In 1958 the American astronomer Herbert Friedman (b. 1916) observed the Sun during a total eclipse, by means of rocket-borne instruments, and detected X rays coming from the Sun's corona. Two years before, he had shown that solar flares emitted X rays, but that was not surprising in view of the fact that flares were clearly very energetic solar explosions. X rays from the apparently quiet corona were more surprising, but this supported the claim of the Swedish physicist Bengt Edlen (b. 1906), who in 1940, as a result of studying the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, had claimed that the corona must have a temperature of a million degrees or so. This does not mean that the Solar corona is a great reservoir of heat. It is a volume of extraordinarily thin gas, where the individual atoms have a great deal of heat individually (hence the temperature), but where there are so few.		
magnetosphere	1958	Magnetosphere	The United States launched Explorer I, II, III, and IV, making a significant discovery about Earth's magnetic field around the atmosphere. This led to the identification of the magnetosphere, which has implications for navigation and electronic equipment.	James Alfred Van Allen	United States	sputnik	Science: Space	In 1958 the United States entered the Space Age. The Soviet Union had placed two satellites in orbit in 1957, Sputnik I on October 4 and Sputnik II on November 3. The latter carried a dog, the first living animal to be placed into orbit. The first successful American satellite was Explorer I, which was launched on January 31, 1958. It carried counters designed to estimate the number of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, and detected about the expected concentrations of particles at heights of up to several hundred miles, but at higher altitudes the number fell to zero. Two other satellites launched soon afterward, one by the United States and one by the Soviet Union, recorded the same phenomenon. The American physicist James Alfred Van Allen (b. 1914) did not believe the count could really fall to zero. He felt that what happened was that the count went so high it put the counter out of action. When Explorer IV was launched by the United States on July 26, 1958, it carried special counters that were shielded with a thin layer of lead to keep out most of the radiation (rather like wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes). The radiation that penetrated the lead was not enough to overwhelm the counters, and now the count went up and up and up with increasing altitudefar higher than scientists had expected. It appeared that surrounding the Earth, outside the atmosphere, there were belts containing high concentrations of charged particles that moved along the lines of force of Earth's magnetic field. These particles approached the Earth's surface in the neighborhood of the Earth's magnetic field. There they were responsible for the aurorae and, at times of unusually high concentration, for magnetic storms that affected the compass and electronic equipment. These belts were at first called the Van Allen belts but were eventually referred to as the magnetosphere. This was the first important discoveryan entirely unexpected oneto be made as a result of the launching of artificial satellites.		
nobelium	1958	Nobelium	A few atoms with atomic number 102 were formed after bombarding Curium. This discovery was confirmed by Seaborg and the element was called Nobelium.		Sweden	mendelevium	Science: Chemistry	The effort to form elements with higher and higher atomic numbers set a new record in 1958 with the formation of a few atoms with the atomic number of 102. There was some delay while the identity of the new atoms was confirmed, and when they were, the element was given the name of nobelium after Nobel (see 1866).		
photocopying	1958	Photocopying	Carlson worked on his method for twenty years and finally perfected it for office use, reduceing dependency on cumbersome traditional methods. Photocopying revolutionized document replication using dry powder and electric charge. 	Chester F. Carlson	United States	xerography	Design	An important aspect of office procedures is the copying of documents. Copying by hand is slow and cumbersome, and errors inevitably arise. Carbon paper and mimeograph machines were great improvements but usually messy. An American physicist, Chester F. Carlson (19061968), strove to find a method of copying that would use dry powder, electric charge, and light. Because nothing moist is used, the procedure he found is called xerography (Greek for 'dry writing'), and because light is used, it is called photocopying. It works by giving paper a positive electric charge and the powder a negative electric charge, so that the powder clings to those places where light does not pene...		
moon-probes	1959	Moon probes	In 1959, the Soviet Union launched several successful Moon probes, including Lunik I, II, and III. Lunik I was the first object to orbit the Sun as an artificial planet, Lunik II impacted the Moon, and Lunik III photographed the Moon's far side.	(Roscosmos)	Russia	sputnik	Space	On January 2, 1959, the Soviet Union launched Lunik I. This was the first rocket to surpass escape velocity (7 miles per second), so that it should recede from Earth indefinitely. It was aimed in the direction of the Moon, so that it was the first Moon probe. It missed the Moon by a considerable margin and took up an independent orbit about the Sun, so that it became the first artificial planet. On September 12, 1959, the Soviet Union launched Lunik II, which was better aimed. It struck the Moon, and for the first time in history, an object made by human beings rested on the surface of another world. Then, on October 4, 1959, two years to the day after the first satellite launch, the Soviet Union sent Lunik III behind the Moon. It sent back the first photographs of the far side, the side never before seen by human beings. Forty minutes of photos were taken from a height of 40,000 miles above the lunar surface. The photographs were fuzzy, but they showed that the far side was riddled with craters as the near side was although lacking the relatively crater-free maria, or seas, that existed on the near side.		
shape-of-the-earth-satellite	1959	Shape of the earth from space	Vanguard I was a U.S. satellite launched to study Earth's orbit and revealed effects of the planet's equatorial bulge. After thousands of revolutions, the Earth was found to be a bit bulkier (by 25 feet) on its southern hemisphere.	United States	United States	shape-of-earth-confirmed	Space	The previous year, the United States had launched a small satellite, Vanguard I. It revolved about the Earth in 2½ hours and its orbit could be studied in great detail. Its perigee (the point of its closest approach to the Earth) moved somewhat with each revolution, in part because of the gravitational pull of the Earth’s equatorial bulge upon it.		
solar-wind	1959	Solar wind	Several days after a solar flare, a magnetic storm could be felt on earth. This solar wind, consisting of an unusually large "gust" of charged particles emitted by the Sun, was theorized by Parker and later verified by Lunik probes.	Eugene Newman Parker	United States	solar-flares, moon-probes	Space	It had been recognized for some time that solar flares were highly energetic phenomena on the surface of the Sun. Eugene Newman Parker had argued the year before that the Sun constantly emitted charged particles in every direction and that these drifted outward through the Solar System, passing Earth. He called them the solar wind. A solar flare might therefore be the source of an unusually large gust of such particles, which on arriving at Earth would intensify the usual effects of the solar wind. The existence of the solar wind was verified by Lunik II and Lunik III on their way toward the Moon in 1959, and later probes did the same.		
hemoglobin-structure	1959	Hemoglobin structure	The structure of the hemoglobin molecule was deciphered using advanced techniques involving X-ray diffraction and heavy metal atoms. This advance allowed for a detailed understanding of protein structures essential to biology.	Max Ferdinand Perutz and John Cowdery Kendrew	England	insulin-structure, heme, x-ray-diffraction	Science: Biology	Six years earlier, Sanger had determined the exact order of the amino acids in a long protein chain, but even that was not sufficient to describe the structure of a protein totally. The amino acid chain bent and curved and was hooked together by a variety of chemical bonds. The three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin was worked out by the study of X-ray diffraction patterns. Perutz found that by adding a heavy metal to each molecule, the atoms would diffract X-rays more effectively, providing better structural insights. By 1959, the three-dimensional position of every atom in the hemoglobin molecule was understood.		
homo-habilis	1959	Homo habilis	By now it was known that Homo Sapiens and Neanderthals overlapped. Homo habilis came into being 2 million years ago and  was capable of shaping stone tools.	Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey	England	peking-man	Science: Anthropology	By now it was known that the two varieties of Homo sapiens, modern human beings and Neanderthal man (see 200,000 B.C.), had been preceded by the smaller-brained Homo erectus (see 500,000 B.C.), who may first have appeared on Earth as much as 1.5 million years ago. Before that there were various species of the genus Australopithecus (see 4,000,000 B.C.). The australopithecines, whose existence seems to have overlapped that of Homo erectus, were hominids in that they more closely resembled human beings than they resembled any ape, living or extinct. Nevertheless, they were sufficiently primitive to be kept out of genus Homo. Did they develop directly into Homo erectus, or was there an intermediate form? The British anthropologist Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (1903-1972), together with his wife, Mary, carefully explored the Olduvai Gorge in what is now Tanzania. There, on July 17, 1959, they came across the first fragments of a skull that, when pieced together, seemed to be a relic of the earliest known representative of genus Homo, a species that came into existence nearly 2 million years ago. This species, intermediate between the australopithecines and Homo erectus, was eventually named Homo habilis (handy human). Homo habilis seemed to be the first hominid capable of shaping stone tools. Until then, all tools of earlier hominids, and of nonhominids for that matter, had been such things as leaves, twigs, shells, bones, and unmodified stones.		
spark-chamber	1959	Spark chamber	Bubble chambers could detect short-lived particles but could not be triggered on demand. Cloud chambers could be triggered but weren't sensitive enough. Spark chambers achieved both by using neon gas that crossed many metal plates.	Saburo Fukui and Shotaro Miyamoto	Japan	bubble-chambers	Science: Physics	Bubble chambers (see 1953) had turned out to be very useful, especially for the detection of ultra-short-lived particles. However, they cannot be triggered by desired events, but record everything. This means that myriads of tracks have to be searched through to find those of significance. Cloud chambers could be set for desired events only, but were insufficiently sensitive to show the newer particles. Something was needed that would be selective as cloud chambers and as sensitive as bubble chambers. This need was met by the spark chamber, in which incoming particles ionized neon gas that was crossed by many metal plates. The ions then conducted an electric current that showed up as a visible line of sparks, marking the passage of the particles. The device could be adjusted to react only to those particles that were under study. The first practical spark chamber was constructed in 1959 by two Japanese physicists, Saburo Fukui and Shotaro Miyamoto.		
color-vision	1959	Color vision	A new theory of color vision proposed additional receptors responsive to white, black, and gray, complementing the traditional RGB model. This theory explained previously unclear effects in color perception.	Edwin Land	United States	photography	Science: Biology	For a century it had been thought that three basic colors were sufficient to reproduce the entire color range, and to combine into white light. The three colors were red, green, and blue. These colors are, in fact, used in color television to produce all the other colors. Furthermore, in the retina of the eye there are three types of cells, one to react with each of the three basic colors. In 1959, however, Land, who had invented Polaroid and the Land camera (see 1932), advanced a new theory of color vision. He proposed that in addition to the three receptor types tuned to the basic colors, there also existed a set of cells responsive to white, black, and shades of gray, which produced a response that could be combined with the color responses. This explained certain effects that were not clarified by the earlier three-color theory.		
laser	1960	Laser	The principle of the continuous maser could be applied to visible wavelengths. The laser uses a ruby cylinder to emit an intense, coherent beam of red light. This invention allows for focused light that can achieve extremely high temperatures.	Theodore Harold Maiman	United States	continuous-maser	Science: Physics	The principle of the maser, which produced an intense, coherent, monochromatic beam of microwaves, could be applied to any wavelength, including those of visible light. The first maserlike device capable of producing an intense, coherent, monochromatic beam of visible light was constructed in May 1960 by the American physicist Theodore Harold Maiman. Maiman designed a ruby cylinder with its ends carefully polished flat and parallel and covered with a thin silver film. Energy was fed into it from a flash lamp until it emitted a beam of red light.		
general-relativity-proof	1960	General relativity proof	The experiment further confirmed general relativity by demonstrating changes in gamma ray absorption. It validated Einstein's theory under laboratory conditions.	Robert Pound and Glen Rebka	United States	general-relativity, mössbauer-effect	Science: Physics	The experiment proved general relativity by testing gamma rays' absorption in a gravitational field, confirming Einstein's theory in a laboratory setting.		
standard-meter	1960	Standard meter	The meter was initially set as 1/10,000,000 the distance from the equator to the North Pole, but could not be established with high accuracy so was set to the distance between scratches on a rust-resistant metal bar. Now it was set to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of one of the spectral lines of an isotope of the rare gas krypton.		France	the-metric-system, neon-krypton-xenon	Science: Measurement	A standard meter was defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of an isotope of the rare gas krypton, increasing precision over the previous platinum-iridium bar standard.		
integrated-circuits	1960	Integrated circuits	Integrated circuits combined numerous transistor circuits onto a single chip. This advancement led to the development of smaller, cost-effective, and versatile computers. Asimov writes "As time went on, more and more circuits eventually thousands could be etched into a single chip"			transistorization	Science: Electronics	Small pieces of silicon or other semiconductor, etched with tiny transistor circuits, called integrated circuits, allowed for smaller, cheaper, and more versatile computers.		
resonance-particles	1960	Resonance particles	Alvarez constructed huge bubble chambers to detect ultra-short-lived particles known as resonance particles, lasting 10^-24 seconds. He was able to deduce their existence from their breakdown products, earning a Nobel Prize for his work.	Luis Walter Alvarez	United States	bubble-chambers, kaons-and-hyperons	Science: Physics	The bubble chamber was excellent at detecting ultra-short-lived particles. The American physicist Luis Walter Alvarez constructed huge bubble chambers and, beginning in 1960, detected particles that existed for only a few trillionths of a trillionth of a second before breaking down. The tracks they left in this incredibly short lifetime, even if they moved at the speed of light, were too small to detect directly. The existence of these so-called resonance particles could only be deduced from the nature of their longer-lived breakdown products. For this work, Alvarez was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1968.		
sea-floor-spreading	1960	Sea-floor spreading	Harry Hammond Hess proposed the theory of sea-floor spreading, where magma from the mantle pushes tectonic plates apart. Continental drift was not the result of continents slowly floating on the underlying rock, but the plates themselves were forced together and apart.	Harry Hammond Hess	United States	continental-drift, plate-tectonics	Science: Geology	In 1960 the American geophysicist Harry Hammond Hess decided it was quite possible that molten magma from the mantle might ooze upward through the Great Global Rift. That might force the North American and South American plates farther westward while the Eurasian and African plates were forced further eastward. The Atlantic ocean would thus widen, in what came to be called sea-floor spreading.		
weather-satellites	1960	Weather satellites	Tiros I and Tiros II were the first weather satellites, sending 20,000 photographs and providing valuable data on Earth's weather patterns. These satellites became crucial for predicting and tracking storms.	(NASA)	United States	sputnik, photography	Space	Satellites intended primarily for the observation of the Earth began to be launched. The first was Tiros I, launched by the United States on April 1, 1960. In November Tiros II was launched, and in ten weeks it sent down over 20,000 photographs of vast stretches of Earth and its cloud cover. These and other weather satellites that followed became indispensable in tracking hurricanes and other violent storms and in helping to predict weather.		
cyclic-amp	1960	Cyclic-AMP	Cyclic-AMP is a molecule crucial for cell metabolism and hormone regulation. It plays a key role in how hormones penetrate cells, leading to significant insights in physiology.	Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr.	United States	coenzyme-structure	Science: Biology	Adenylic acid, also known as adenosine monophosphate (AMP), is one of the nucleotides that make up the molecular chains of nucleic acids. The American pharmacologist Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr. (1915-1974) had discovered it in tissue some years earlier, and in 1960 he worked out its structure. He found that the phosphate group was attached to the rest of the molecule in two different places rather than one. A ring of atoms was thus formed, and Sutherland called it cyclic-AMP. Cyclic-AMP has a profound effect on the course of metabolism within a cell, since it apparently controls the way hormones can penetrate cells. For this work, Sutherland was awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1971.		
chlorophyll-synthesis	1960	Chlorophyll synthesis	Chlorophyll synthesis was achieved, marking a significant advance in organic chemistry. This achievement contributed to the understanding of complex molecule synthesis.	Robert Burns Woodward	United States	chloroplast-isolation, strychnine-synthesis	Science: Chemistry	In 1960 Woodward, who specialized in synthesizing complex organic molecules, succeeded in synthesizing chlorophyll.		
human-beings-in-space	1961	Human beings in space	The Soviet Union put Laika in space four years before, and eventually put dogs in space and brought them back alive. In 1961 it launched Gagarin into space, successfully orbiting the Earth and returning safely, followed by Titov who orbited around the earth seventeen times over one full day.	Yury Alekseyevich Gagarin and Gherman Stepanovich Titov	Russia	v-two	Space	On April 21, 1961, Yury Alekseyevich Gagarin (1934–1968) was put into orbit by the Soviet Union in the spaceship Vostok I. He circled the Earth once in 89 minutes and was brought back alive. On August 6, 1961, a second Soviet cosmonaut, Gherman Stepanovich Titov (b. 1935), was put into orbit and circled the Earth seventeen times, remaining in space for a full day.		
microwave-reflections-from-venus	1961	Microwave reflections from Venus	Microwave signals were sent to Venus and reflected back to Earth, allowing precise measurements of distance. This advancement improved the understanding of the Solar System's scale.		Russia, England, and United States	microwave-reflection-from-the-moon, distance-of-the-sun-eros	Space	Fifteen years before, microwaves had been reflected from the Moon. By 1961 the technique had advanced to the point where microwaves could be sent out to Venus, a hundred times as far away as the Moon. This was done, and reflections were received by five different groups, one Soviet, one British, and three American. The microwaves traveled through space at the speed of light, and from the time measured between the emission of the original beam and the detection of the reflection, the distance of Venus and therefore the general scale of the Solar System could be determined much more accurately than had been possible from observations of the asteroid Eros (see 1941).		
heliosphere	1961	Heliosphere	Using the Echo I satellite, scientists accurately measured atmospheric drag and air density at high altitudes, identifying a region filled largely with helium. This discovery contributed to the understanding of Earth's upper atmosphere, known as the heliosphere.	Marcel Nicolet	Belgium	weather-satellites	Science: Atmospheric Science	The previous year, the United States had put up Echo I, which expanded into a large sphere of aluminum foil from which microwave reflections could be obtained. By 1961 its orbit had been followed so carefully that the Belgian physicist Marcel Nicolet could calculate the drag of the thin wisps of atmosphere present at the heights through which the satellite was moving. The large volume of the satellite and its comparative lightness magnified that drag so that it was possible to deduce the density of the air at a height of from 200 to 600 miles above Earth’s surface and to show that it consisted largely of helium. This region was known as the heliosphere.		
quarks	1961	Quarks	A new classification system for hadrons (subatomic particle) was developed, organizing them into families based on increasing properties he whimsically called the Eightfold Way (from Buddhism). This new system involved quarks (from Finnegan's Wake) with fractional electric charges (1/3, 2/3) and like Mendeleev's periodic table, predicted gaps that would later be filled.	Murray Gell-Mann	United States	strange-particles, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Physics	In 1961 Gell-Mann, who had advanced an explanation of strange particles (see 1953), worked out a method for bringing order to the numerous hadrons that were being discovered. He grouped them into families in which certain particle properties increased in value in a regular pattern.		
lawrencium	1961	Lawrencium	Lawrencium, the last of the actinides, was discovered as a result of producing a few atoms of element 103. This discovery increased the actinide elements to fifteen, matching the number of lanthanides and filling out the f-block in the periodic table.	Sikkeland, Larsh, and Latimer	United States	nobelium, astatine, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Chemistry	The attempt to produce more and more complex atoms did not cease. In 1961 a few atoms of element 103 were produced, and it was named lawrencium after Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron (see 1930), who had died three years earlier. With lawrencium, the last of the actinides (see 1940) was discovered. There were now fifteen actinides as there were fifteen lanthanides.		
genetic-code	1961	Genetic code	Nirenberg synthesized polyuridylic acid corresponding to a chain of uracil nucleotides (U-U-U). When he used this as messenger RNA, it formed a protein, made up of only one amino acid: phenylalanine, establishing the mapping for U-U-U. Similar techniques were applied for the rest of the trinucleotides to work out the whole genetic code.	Marshall Warren Nirenberg	United States	transfer-rna, nucleic-acid-formation, genetic-code-theory	Science: Biology	With the transition of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA to transfer RNA to protein now well established (see 1956), the most important unanswered question was which trinucleotide corresponded to which amino acid. Without knowing that, one couldn’t understand how information passed from DNA to proteins. The American biochemist Marshall Warren Nirenberg (b. 1927) took the first step toward elucidating the problem. He made use of the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (see 1955) to form an RNA molecule out of a mixture that consisted of uridylic acid only. The RNA molecule that resulted was not one that existed naturally but a synthetic, polyuridylic acid (—U—U—U—U—U—U—U—U—U—), made up of a chain of uracil nucleotides only. The only possible trinucleotide in such an RNA molecule would be U—U—U. When Nirenberg used polyuridylic acid as messenger RNA, it worked. Transfer-RNA molecules settled upon it and amino acids combined to form a protein. The protein was made up only of the amino acid phenylalanine. This made it quite clear that the trinucleotide U—U—U was equivalent to the amino acid phenylalanine.		
gene-regulators	1961	Gene regulators	Gene regulators were discovered to control the rate at which genes function, explaining the differing chemistries in identical genetic makeup cells. This finding advanced the understanding of gene expression and cellular function.	Jacques-Lucien Monod and François Jacob 	France	the-double-helix	Science: Genetics	Jacob and Monod, who had first suggested the existence of messenger RNA (see 1956), puzzled over the fact that different cells in a body had different chemistries even though they all had the same genetic makeup. They decided that genes did not always work at the same rate, that there were devices that could slow down or speed up the workings of a particular gene, and that different		
electronic-watch	1961	Electronic watch	Electronic watches, introduced in 1961, eliminated the need for winding and mechanical parts. They revolutionized timekeeping with battery-powered precision.			dry-cell, transistorization	Design	In 1961 electronic watches were put on the market. Gone were the mainsprings and hair springs, gone the ticking sound, gone the daily necessity of winding. The watch's action was controlled by the vibration of a tiny tuning fork kept in steady action by a small battery. Replacing the battery once a year or so was all that was required.		
american-in-space	1962	American in space	Friendship 7 marked a significant achievement by placing the first American in orbit. It highlighted the capabilities of the United States in space exploration during the early Space Age.	John Herschel Glenn, Jr.	United States	v-two	Space	On February 20, 1962, the United States launched Friendship 7, which placed the first American in orbit. He was John Herschel Glenn, Jr. (b. 1921), who orbited the Earth three times and remained in space for 5 hours.		
communications-satellites	1962	Communications satellites	Telstar I was launched to improve global communications by relaying and amplifying radio waves. This marked a significant step toward global connectivity and communication.	(Bell Labs)	United States	heliosphere, radio-waves, sputnik	Science: Technology	On July 10, 1962, the United States launched Telstar I. It was a true communications satellite since it not only received radio waves but amplified them before sending them on.		
venus-probe	1962	Venus probe	Mariner 2 was the first successful probe to another planet, marking a new era in space exploration. It provided valuable data about Venus, measuring surface temperature at 475°C, confirming the existence of a solar wind, and detecting microwave radiation.		United States	solar-wind	Space	The first successful planetary probe was Mariner 2, launched by the United States on August 27, 1962. It was designed to approach the planet Venus and passed within 22,000 miles of Venus's cloud layer on December 14, 1962.		
rotation-of-venus	1962	Rotation of venus	Venus, despite being Earth's closest neighbor, remained shrouded in mystery because of its thick and featureless cloud layer. Scientists used microwave reflections to determine Venus's very slow period of axial rotation of 250 days.	Roland L. Carpenter and Richard M. Goldstein	United States	microwave-reflections-from-venus	Space	In 1962, the rotation of Venus was determined using microwave reflections. From the extent of the distortion, the speed of rotation could be calculated accurately.		
noble-gas-compounds	1962	Noble gas compounds	Pauling pointed out that inert gas atoms grew less inert as their atomic number increased. Noble gases were traditionally considered inert until Bartlett found that platinum fluoride reacts with xenon. This breakthrough expanded the understanding of chemical bonding and reactivity.	Neil Bartlett	England	neon-krypton-xenon, periodic-table-of-the-elements	Science: Chemistry	In 1962 the British-born Canadian chemist Neil Bartlett found that a compound, platinum fluoride, was almost as active as fluorine itself and easier to work with. He immersed it in xenon gas and the two substances combined to form xenon fluoroplatinate. This was the first known case of an inert gas atom forming a bond with any other atom or group of atoms.		
approach-to-absolute-zero-final	1962	Closer approach to absolute zero	Previous attempts at very low temperatures reached 1/50,000 of a degree above absolute zero. Now, using helium isotopes helium-4 and helium-3 which separate at temperatures below 0.8° and additional nuclear magnetic properties, temperatures of one millionth of a degree were reached.	Heinz London	England	approach-to-absolute-zero, quantum-electrodynamics	Science: Physics	In 1962 the German-born British physicist Heinz London used a mixture of the two helium isotopes helium-4 and helium-3 for the purpose. Ordinarily they mix perfectly, but at temperatures below 0.8°, they separate. Processes that allowed the two isotopes to mix and then separate repeatedly offered a powerful new way of cooling. Thanks to this and to other techniques involving helium-3 and nuclear magnetic properties, temperatures of 1/1,000,000 of a degree above absolute zero have been attained.		
light-emitting-diodes	1962	Light-emitting diodes	Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) became developed for practical use, allowing for their application in various display and indicator technologies. Their efficiency and functionality have made them integral to numerous electronic devices.		England	transistorization	Science: Physics	Such diodes are now routinely used where light needs merely to be seen and not to illuminate. Thus, light-emitting diodes are used in digital clocks, in pocket computers, in elevator floor indicators, in taxi meters, and as signals in electronic equipment generally.		
environment	1962	Environment	The book 'Silent Spring' raised awareness of the environmental impact of indiscriminate pesticide use, particularly on bird populations. It played a significant role in increasing public consciousness about ecological issues.	Rachel Louise Carson	United States	ddt	Science: Biology	It happened in 1962, when Silent Spring, by the American biologist Rachel Louise Carson (1907–1964), was published. Her account of the effect of indiscriminate use of pesticides on the environment was riveting. She described the possibility that pesticides would kill birds, for instance, to the point where spring would finally arrive without birdsong. The book was largely responsible for a sudden increase in awareness of environmental dangers on the part of a large segment of the public.		
quasars	1963	Quasars	Quasars (quasistellar radio sources) were identified as compact yet highly radio-active celestial radio sources, listed in the Third Cambridge Catalog of Radio Stars. They were theorized to be galaxies with active centers billions of light years away.	Martin Ryle and others	England	jodrell-bank, seyfert-galaxies	Space	Among the radio sources located in the sky during the 1950s were a few that seemed confined to very small areas. These compact sources were known as 3C48, 3C147, 3C196, 3C273, and 3C286. The 3C is short for Third Cambridge Catalog of Radio Stars, a listing compiled by the British astronomer Martin Ryle (1918–1984).		
arecibo-radio-telescope	1963	Arecibo radio telescope	The Arecibo Radio Telescope, built in 1963 in Puerto Rico, was the largest single radio telescope at that time at 1000 feet across.	(NASA)	United States	jodrell-bank	Space	In 1963 the largest single radio telescope ever built was put into use. It was located about 8 miles south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and is about 1,000 feet across. It is not steerable, however, but is fixed in place.		
x-ray-sources	1963	X-ray sources in space	Light and microwaves can pass through Earth's atmosphere, but X-rays cannot. Rocketry allowed the detection of X-rays from astronomical objects, and X-rays were shortly detected from the Crab nebula.	Bruno Rossi	United States	crab-nebula, solar-x-rays	Space	Through most of history, the only information reaching us from the stars had consisted of visible light waves. For the past thirty years, microwaves from astronomical objects had also been studied. Both light and microwaves can penetrate Earth's atmosphere, but there are other forms of radiation that cannot. They can only be studied by rockets, carrying appropriate instruments, that are sent up beyond the atmosphere. Thus, X rays from astronomical objects are completely absorbed by the atmosphere and cannot be observed from Earth's surface. Rocketry, however, had made it possible to detect X rays in the solar radiation. Still more interesting news came in 1963, when Bruno Rossi, who had done important work on cosmic rays, began to use rockets to observe whether solar X rays were reflected from the Moon. He did not succeed in detecting such radiation. However, he did detect it emerging from the Crab nebula and also from another supernova remnant in the constellation of Scorpio. As rocket observation became more common and more sophisticated, many other X-ray sources beyond the Solar System were located.		
hydroxyl-group-detection	1963	Hydroxyl group detection	Characteristic wavelengths of hydroxyl groups were detected in space. This discovery suggests that hydroxyl groups can exist outside Earth, unlike on Earth where they quickly combine with other atoms.	Weinreb	United States	interstellar-matter, hydrogen-radiation	Science: Chemistry	In 1963, two characteristic wavelengths were detected, indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups in interplanetary space.		
woman-in-space	1963	Woman in space	The Soviet Union successfully launched the first woman into orbit, marking a historic event in space exploration. This achievement highlighted the advancing role of women in science and space exploration.	Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova	Russia	human-beings-in-space	Space	On June 18, 1963, the Soviet Union launched Vostok 6, bearing Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova, the first woman to be placed into orbit about the Earth.		
magnetic-reversals	1963	Magnetic reversals	Brunhes observed that in some rocks, crystals magnetized in directions opposite to Earth's magnetic field. This was initially ignored but then suggested that Earth's magnetic field fluctuated and even changed polarity completely. This was verified with magma sediment on the seafloor which showed both evidence of seafloor spreading and of irregular reversals of the magnetic field.	Bernard Brunhes	France	sea-floor-spreading, north-magnetic-pole	Science: Geology	Bernard Brunhes had noted that in some rocks, crystals magnetized in directions opposite to that of Earth's magnetic field. Further investigations showed that magnetic reversals occurred at intervals in Earth's history as sediments on the Atlantic Ocean's floor had reversed magnetization.		
background-microwave-radiation	1964	Background microwave radiation	Using a big horn-shaped antenna built to detect radio reflections, Penzias and Wilson found an unexplainable excess of radio emissions coming from all directions with equal intensity. This was the predicted background radiation that would be a consequence of the big bang.	Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson	United States	heliosphere, the-big-bang	Science: Physics	The German-born American physicist Arno Allan Penzias and the American radio astronomer Robert Woodrow Wilson were attempting to determine the characteristics of any radio-wave emission that might come from the outer regions of the Galaxy. They made use of a big horn-shaped antenna originally built to detect radio reflections from the Echo satellite since 1961. In May 1964 they found an excess of radio-wave emission that they could not explain. When they had accounted for all possible sources of error, they found that there was a distinct background microwave radiation, coming from all directions with equal intensity. They turned to the American physicist Robert Henry Dicke, who remembered that Gamow had predicted such background radiation would occur as a consequence of the big bang. The background radiation was characteristic of a universe with an average temperature of 3 degrees above absolute zero, and it could be assumed that the Universe had cooled to that average temperature from that prevailing at the moment of the big bang.		
omega-minus-particle	1964	Omega-minus particle	The Omega-minus particle with strangeness number of –2 was found. It was predicted based on the Eightfold Way, a system for classifying particles. Its discovery helped validate the method and deepened understanding of particle physics.	Murray Gell-Mann	United States	quarks, bevatron	Science: Physics	Gell-Mann had suggested the Eightfold Way as a means of ordering hadrons into groups. In one of the groups he had set up was an empty spot that ought to hold a particle with a particular set of properties if his method of arrangement was valid.		
cpt-symmetry	1964	CPT symmetry	After it was shown that parity was not conserved in the waek interaction, parity was combined with "charge conjugation" which told whether you were dealing with a particle or an antiparticle. It was shown that charge and parity (CP) together was conserved. But then it was found that Neutral kaons did not conserve CP, but did if you added time (T). Thus CPT.	Val Logsdon Fitch, James Watson Cronin	United States	conservation-of-parity, kaons-and-hyperons	Science: Physics	After Lee and Yang had shown that parity was not conserved in the weak interaction, parity was combined with charge conjugation with the idea that if parity was unbalanced in one direction in a particular particle, charge conjugation would be unbalanced in the other, and the two together would be conserved. This was called CP (charge-parity) conservation. But in 1964 two American physicists, Val Logsdon Fitch and James Watson Cronin, found that CP was not always conserved either.		
transfer-rna-structure	1964	Transfer-RNA structure	Alanine's transfer RNA's structure was analyzed, revealing it is made up of seventy-seven nucleotides forming a three-lobed structure. This discovery advanced understanding of genetic coding and protein synthesis.	Robert William Holley	United States	transfer-rna, insulin-structure	Science: Biology	In 1964 the molecule of alanine-transfer RNA was completely analyzed by a team headed by the American biochemist Robert William Holley. As Sanger had worked with insulin, so Holley worked with transfer RNA, breaking it down to fragments, identifying the fragments, and working out how they fit together.		
multiperson-spaceflight	1964	Multiperson spaceflight	The Voshkod 1 mission marked the first time a spacecraft carried more than one person into orbit. This event expanded human spaceflight capabilities beyond single-occupant missions.	(Roscosmos)	Russia	human-beings-in-space	Space	On October 12, 1964, the Soviet Union launched Voshkod 1, which carried three cosmonauts into orbit. It was the first rocket to carry more than one human being.		
rutherfordium	1964	Rutherfordium	Element 104 was synthesized, sparking a naming controversy between Soviet and American scientists. This discovery contributed to the expansion of the periodic table with a new transuranium element. The soviets named it Kurchatovium after the leader of the Soviet nuclear bomb project.		United States, Russia	lawrencium	Science: Chemistry	In 1964 both Soviet and American researchers reported the formation of atoms of element number 104. There was some dispute as to priority and name. The Soviets named it kurchatovium after Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov, while the Americans named it rutherfordium after Ernest Rutherford.		
martian-craters	1965	Martian craters	The Mariner 4 probe passed within 6000 miles of the Martian surface and provided the first close-up images of Mars, revealing cratered landscapes similar to the Moon. This ended speculation of advanced Martian civilizations and canals.	(NASA)	United States	martian-canals	Space	The Mars probe Mariner 4 had been launched by the United States on November 28, 1964. On July 14, 1965, it passed within 6,000 miles of the Martian surface. As it did so, it took a series of twenty photographs, which were turned into microwave signals, beamed back to Earth, and there converted into photographs again. For the first time in history, close-up views of the Martian surface could be seen by human beings. What those photographs showed were craters very much resembling those of the Moon. There was no sign of canals. The photographs did not cover very much of the Martian surface, but the general impression was one of a Moonlike world, not an Earthlike one. The notion of artificial canals and an advanced civilization, already shaky because of increased knowledge concerning the thin, oxygen-free atmosphere of Mars, now died a final death.		
rotation-of-mercury	1965	Rotation of mercury	Microwave data indicated Mercury's rotation period is approximately 59 days, disproving the belief that it always faced one side towards the Sun. This discovery revealed Mercury's dynamic rotational behavior.	Rolf Buchanan Dyce, Gordon H. Pettengill	United States	mercurys-rotation	Space	Schiaparelli had suggested that Mercury turned one face to the Sun at all times. This had begun to seem doubtful, since if it were true, the side of Mercury facing away from the Sun should be extremely cold. Microwaves detected from the dark side of Mercury in 1962 had indicated it was considerably warmer than would be expected if it were eternally dark. In 1965 two American electrical engineers, Rolf Buchanan Dyce and Gordon H. Pettengill, working with microwave reflections from the Mercurian surface, were able to show that it turned on its axis in about 59 days, despite the fact that it revolved about the Sun in 88 days. This meant that every portion of the planet received sunlight at one time or another. Eventually, the rotation was found to be 58.65		
spacewalks	1965	Spacewalks	Spacewalks allowed humans to leave their spacecraft and remain tethered in space. This marked significant progress in space exploration and astronaut capabilities.	Aleksei Leonov, Edward Higgins White II	Russia, United States	multiperson-spaceflight	Space	In 1965 human beings were able to leave their orbiting rockets and, held by a tether, remain free in space—within their spacesuits, of course. This was referred to as a spacewalk. The first to take a spacewalk was the Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov, who left the rocket ship Voskhod II on March 18, 1965. The American astronaut Edward Higgins White II (1930–1967) left his ship, Gemini 4, on June 3, 1965.		
space-rendezvous	1965	Space rendezvous	Maneuverability in space was increasing rapidly. The American satellite Gemini VII approached within several feet of the previously launched Gemini VI marking the first space rendezvous.	(NASA)	United States	sputnik	Space	Maneuverability in space was increasing rapidly. On December 15, 1965, the American satellite Gemini VII, having been in space for fourteen days, approached within several feet of the previously launched Gemini VI. This was the first space rendezvous.		
commercial-communications-satellites	1965	Commercial communications satellites	NASA launched Early Bird, the first commercial communications satellite. It enabled 240 voice circuits and one TV channel. The Soviet Union also began to send their own communications satellites.	(NASA and Roscosmos)	United States, Russia	communications-satellites	Space	On April 6, 1965, the United States launched Early Bird, the first communications satellite intended primarily for commercial use. It made available 240 voice circuits and one television channel. In this year the Soviet Union also began to send up communications signals.		
venus-lander	1965	Venus lander	A Soviet probe crash landed on Venus, marking the first human-made object to reach another planet. This was a landmark achievement in planetary exploration.	(Roscosmos)	Russia	sputnik	Space	The Soviet Union was making repeated efforts to explore Venus. During the course of 1965, one of its Venus probes struck Venus and became the first human-made object to reach another planet.		
practical-hologram	1965	Holograms	Once the laser was invented, it proved an ideal light source to set up real images in in space, like three-dimensional photographs.	Emmet N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks	United States	laser, holography, photography	Science: Physics	Gabor had worked out the theoretical basis of holography (see 1947), a system of photography that recorded the interference patterns of an ordinary and a reflected beam of light. Holography made it possible to set up a real image in space, something that amounted to a three-dimensional photograph. Once the laser had been invented (see 1960) and come into use, it proved an ideal light source for the purpose. In 1965 Emmet N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks, at the University of Michigan, were able to produce the first holograms.		
microfossils	1965	Microfossils	The earliest known fossils were in rocks from the Cambrian era, a little over 600 million years old. Now microfossils, identified in ancient rocks, indicated early bacterial life on Earth from 3,500 million years ago.	Elso Sterrenberg Barghoorn	United States	fossils, electron-microscope-improved	Science: Biology	In 1965, however, the American paleontologist Elso Sterrenberg Barghoorn (1913–1984) worked with tiny bits of carbonized material in very ancient rocks and showed that they might represent bacteria living in the early eons of Earth’s history. When these bits of material were eventually studied by electron microscope, they showed		
protein-synthesis	1965	Protein synthesis	Due to the work of Sanger and Perutz and others, structures of protein were fully deciphered. Merrifield synthesized insulin and Phillips synthesized lysozyme.	Robert Bruce Merrifield, David Phillips	United States, England	insulin-structure, hemoglobin-structure	Science: Biology	In 1965 the American biochemist Robert Bruce Merrifield succeeded in synthesizing insulin. In that same year, a Welsh biochemist, David Phillips, synthesized lysozyme.		
moon-at-close-quarters	1966	Moon at close quarters	The Soviet Luna 9 achieved the first soft landing on the Moon. Six months later the American Surveyor 1 did the same, taking many more photographs of higher quality. Luna 10 became the first orbital probe around the Moon and the US followed suite, mapping the entire surface of the moon.	(NASA and Roscosmos)	United States, Russia	sputnik	Space	On February 3, the Soviet Moon probe Luna 9 made the first soft landing on the Moon (one in which the landing vessel was not destroyed in the process) and took some photographs of the approaching surface. On June 2, the American Moon probe, Surveyor 1, did the same, taking many more photographs of better quality. On April 3, the Soviet probe Luna 10 was the first to be placed into orbit about the Moon. The first of a series of American probes to go into orbit about the Moon (the Luna Orbiters) followed, and the United States was able to map the entire surface of the Moon, both the side facing us and the side away from us, in full detail.		
space-docking	1966	Space-docking	Gemini VIII achieved the first docking of two space vessels in orbit, demonstrating a crucial capability for future lunar missions. This milestone was essential for planning manned Moon landings and returns.	(NASA)	United States	space-rendezvous	Space	On March 16, the American satellite Gemini VIII linked up with another orbiting vessel. This was the first actual docking of one space vessel with another—a maneuver essential if human beings were to be sent to the Moon and brought safely back.		
pulsars	1967	Pulsars	Hewish supervised the construction of a device with 2,048 separate receivers spread out in an array that covered an area of nearly 3 acres. This array detected regular bursts of microwaves from a place between Vega and Altair, lasting 1/13 of a second, occurring every 1.3 seconds. This object was eventually called a pulsating star or pulsar.	Anthony Hewish	England	radio-telescope	Space	For some years there had been indications of radio sources in the sky that changed intensity after brief intervals, but radio telescopes at that time were not designed to catch such brief 'twinkles.' Then, in Great Britain, the British astronomer Anthony Hewish (b. 1924) supervised the construction of a device with 2,048 separate receivers spread out in an array that covered an area of nearly 3 acres. This was designed to detect brief changes in microwave intensities. In July 1967 the array was put to work, and within a month a graduate student, Jocelyn Bell, had detected bursts of microwaves from a place midway between Vega and Altair. The bursts were astonishingly brief, lasting only a thirtieth of a second. Even more astonishing, they followed one another with remarkable regularity—at intervals that were finally measured at 1.33730109 seconds. This object was eventually called a pulsating star, a phrase quickly abbreviated to pulsar. Eventually hundreds of pulsars were located. Hewish was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for physics in 1974.		
venuss-atmosphere	1967	Venus's atmosphere	Soviet Venus probes revealed that Venus's atmosphere is extremely dense and primarily composed of carbon dioxide, causing a severe greenhouse effect. This discovery highlighted Venus as the hottest planet in the Solar System.		Russia	greenhouse-effect	Space	The Soviet Union continued to send out Venus probes that didn’t last long because of the fearsome temperature and pressure of Venus's atmosphere. By 1967 the probes had made it clear that Venus's atmosphere was about ninety times as dense as Earth's—far denser than anyone had expected. That atmosphere is about 96.6 percent carbon dioxide, and virtually all the rest is nitrogen. There is about as much nitrogen in Venus's atmosphere as in Earth's, but it is dwarfed by the overwhelming quantity of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide produces a runaway greenhouse effect that makes Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System, hotter even than Mercury.		
space-casualties	1967	Space casualties	The Space Age marked its first human casualties with the deaths of three American astronauts during an Apollo test and a Soviet cosmonaut during the Soyuz flight. These incidents highlighted the risks involved in the space exploration missions.	(NASA and Roscosmos)	United States, Russia	multiperson-spaceflight	Space	The Space Age, now ten years old, saw its first human casualties. On January 27, 1967, three American astronauts died while an Apollo capsule was being tested on the ground. They were Virgil Ivan (Gus) Grissom (1926–1967), who had orbited in Gemini 3 in 1965; Edward White, who had been the first American to take a spacewalk (see 1965), and Roger Bruce Chaffee (1935–1967). On April 24, 1967, the Soviet spacecraft Soyuz made its first flight, but during the return to Earth, the ship became tangled in its parachute lines and the cosmonaut, Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov (1927–1967), who had piloted the first multiperson spacecraft (see 1964), died. He was the first person to die in the course of an actual spaceflight.		
heart-transplants	1967	Heart transplants	The first successful heart transplant was performed, allowing a patient to live for over a year with a new heart. This groundbreaking operation paved the way for future heart transplants despite initial ethical concerns.	Christiaan Neethling Barnard	South Africa	kidney-transplant, heart-lung-machine	Science: Medicine	On December 3, 1967, the South African surgeon Christiaan Neethling Barnard performed the first human heart transplant.		
vertebrate-clones	1967	Vertebrate clones	Clone is Greek for "twig", harkening to plant grafting. The first clone of a vertebrate was achieved using nuclear transplantation in frogs. Amphibian ova, unlike bird and reptile eggs, are unprotected by a shell and are easier to work with. This marked a significant advancement in genetics and cloning research.	John B. Gurdon	England	embryo-organizer	Science: Biology	In 1967 the British biologist John B. Gurdon applied this technique of a nuclear transplantation to transferring a cell from the intestine of a South African clawed frog to an egg cell of another individual of the same species.		
hahnium	1967	Hahnium	Hahnium, element number 105, was discovered and named in 1967. This discovery added to the expanding periodic table and highlighted advances in chemical research.		United States	rutherfordium	Science: Chemistry	In 1967 the formation of element number 105 was reported in the United States, and it was named hahnium, after Otto Hahn.		
electroweak-interaction	1968	Electroweak interaction	The electroweak interaction unifies electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces into a single framework. Careful observations showed that electromagnetic and weak forces are the same at high enough temperatures.	Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Lee Glashow, Abdus Salam	United States and Pakistan	weak-interaction, electromagnetism	Science: Physics	In 1968, physicists Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Lee Glashow, and Abdus Salam developed a mathematical treatment that unified the electromagnetic and weak interactions, known as the electroweak interaction. This theory demonstrated that these forces are aspects of a single interaction at high temperatures and was verified through experimental observations.		
solar-neutrinos	1968	Solar neutrinos	Previous discovery of antineutrinos made the existence of neutrinos certain, but there was no experimental proof yet. To remedy, Reines set up a tank containing 100,000 gallons of tetrachloryethylene in a mine in South Dakota, left it exposed for several months and came back with definitive proof of argon (and helium) from chlorine reacting with neutrinos.	Frederick Reines	United States	detection-of-the-neutrino, solar-energy	Science: Physics	Although neutrinos had previously been detected as antineutrinos, in 1968, the existence of solar neutrinos was confirmed. The Sun's energy production through hydrogen fusion to helium generates vast quantities of neutrinos, which have become possible to detect directly.		
astrochemistry	1968	Astrochemistry	Astrochemistry began with the detection of microwave frequencies from molecules in space. Improved microwave radiation detection showed unexpected complex atom combinations at astronomical distances, leading to discoveries of compounds involving up to thirteen atoms.			hydroxyl-group-detection	Science: Chemistry	In 1968 microwave frequencies characteristic of water molecules (with three atoms each) and ammonia molecules (with four atoms each) were detected in interstellar gas clouds. This was the beginning of what came to be called astrochemistry. Since then, more and more complicated atom groupings have been detected, some involving as many as thirteen atoms.		
rotating-neutron-stars	1968	Rotating neutron stars	The hypothesis that pulsars are rotating neutron stars explained how they produce rapid pulsations. Neutron stars emit beams of radiation due to their magnetic fields and rotation, losing energy as they spin.	Thomas Gold		neutron-stars-theory, pulsars	Space	In 1968 Thomas Gold suggested that pulsars were neutron stars that were rotating. Neutron stars, with intense magnetic fields, emit charged particles at magnetic poles that sweep across space as they rotate, explaining the rapid pulsations.		
circumnavigation-of-the-moon	1968	Circumnavigation of the moon	The unmanned Soviet probe Zond 5 and a manned American mission both successfully circumnavigated the Moon. This event marked a significant step towards achieving a manned lunar landing.	(NASA and Roscosmos)	United States, Russia	moon-at-close-quarters, multiperson-spaceflight	Space	On September 17, 1968, the Soviet probe Zond 5, with no crew aboard, circumnavigated the Moon. On December 24, 1968, the American probe Apollo 8, with three astronauts aboard—Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, Jr., and William A. Anders—circumnavigated the Moon ten times.		
human-beings-on-the-moon	1969	Human beings on the moon	Apollo 11 successfully landed humans on the Moon for the first time, achieving a major milestone in space exploration. This mission demonstrated human ability to travel and work in space.	Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins	United States	circumnavigation-of-the-moon	Space	At 4:18 P.M. eastern daylight savings time on July 20, 1969, Neil Alden Armstrong and Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr., brought the lunar module of Apollo 11 to the surface of the Moon, while Michael Collins remained in orbit about the Moon. Neil Armstrong stepped out, the first human being to set foot on any world other than the Earth.		
cosmonaut-transfer	1969	Cosmonaut transfer	Two Soviet spacecraft met in space, allowing cosmonauts to transfer between them for the first time. This marked a significant step in human space mobility.	(Roscosmos)	Russia	multiperson-spaceflight	Space	On January 14, 1969, two Soviet spacecraft, each carrying cosmonauts, met in space, and cosmonauts passed from one ship to the other. It was the first time human beings had transferred from one spacecraft to another in flight and was another advance in human mobility in space.		
optical-pulsars	1969	Optical pulsars	Known pulsars were emitting microwaves, and no visible ones had been found. Now the first optical pulsar was detected near the center of the Crab nebula, which was also emitting X-rays.	Cocke, Disney, and Taylor	England	rotating-neutron-stars, crab-nebula	Science: Astronomy	In January 1969, sure enough, a star near the center of the Crab nebula was found to be blinking on and off thirty times a second, in time to the microwave pulses. It was the first optical pulsar to be detected. The Crab nebula pulsar was found to be emitting pulses of X rays as well.		
antarctic-meteorites	1969	Antarctic meteorites	Meteorites are hard to find because many that have fallen on earth have been collected by people who made use of their iron contents. Japanese geologists discovered meteorites on the Antarctic ice cap, leading to increased study and collection of meteoric fragments.		Japan	meteorites, antarctica	Science: Geology	In 1969 a group of Japanese geologists came across nine closely spaced meteorites on the Antarctic ice cap. These roused the interest of scientists generally, and thousands of meteoric fragments have been found since, which have made it possible to study the subject in greater detail.		
protein-structure	1969	Protein structure	Edelman worked out the structure of gamma globulin, crucial for antibody formation. Hodgkin worked out the insulin molecule's 3D structure. Choh Hao Li synthesized ribonuclease, the first enzyme to be synthesized, and the even more complex growth hormone the next year.	Gerald Maurice Edelman	United States	insulin-structure	Science: Biology	In 1969 the American biochemist Gerald Maurice Edelman worked out the structure of a gamma globulin, a type of protein that exists in the blood and out of which various antibodies are formed.		
artificial-heart-implant	1969	Artificial heart implant	An artificial plastic heart designed by Liotta was successfully implanted by Cooley and remained in the patient for three days before it was replaced with a natural heart transplant.	Denton Cooley and Domongo Liotta	United States	heart-transplants	Science: Medicine	The first attempt to place such an artificial heart inside a human being was made in 1969. The American surgeon Denton Cooley implanted a plastic heart designed by the Argentine-born American Domingo Liotta.		
coronary-bypass-surgery	1969	Coronary bypass surgery	Coronary bypass surgery was developed, allowing blood rerouting around clogged arteries. This procedure improved survival and quality of life for heart patients.		United States	heart-lung-machine	Science: Medicine	In 1969 a surgical technique was developed of using veins or sometimes arteries from the patient's own body to lead the blood around the clogged portions of the coronaries.		
black-hole-evaporation	1970	Black hole evaporation	Black Hole Evaporation proposes that black holes can lose mass through radiation due to quantum mechanical effects. This discovery suggests that black holes will eventually evaporate over time, impacting our understanding of the Universe.	Stephen William Hawking	England	black-holes	Science: Physics	In 1970, however, the British physicist Stephen William Hawking (b. 1942) reasoned from quantum mechanical considerations that black holes might have a temperature. Therefore, if surrounded by an environment with a lower temperature, black holes would evaporate. Massive black holes with the mass of a star or of many stars would evaporate so slowly that they would endure for many, many times the present age of the Universe. As their mass decreased, however, their rate of evaporation would increase.		
meteoritic-amino-acids	1970	Meteoritic amino acids	The discovery of amino acids in a rare carbonaceous chondrite meteorite supports the theory of life's extraterrestrial origins. Combined with findings of astrochemistry, this suggests that some building blocks of life on Earth may come from space.	Cyril Ponnamperuma	United States	origin-of-life-experiment, astrochemistry	Science: Chemistry	The Sri Lanka–born American biochemist Cyril Ponnamperuma (b. 1923) was continuing to attempt to produce molecules of biochemical interest from the primordial constituents of Earth's atmosphere, in the line of experimentation begun by Miller (see 1952). This investigation into life's origins took an unusual turn in 1970 when Ponnamperuma studied a meteorite that had fallen in Australia the year before. It was of a rare kind called a carbonaceous chondrite, a fragile black material that contained measurable quantities of water and organic material. Ponnamperuma showed that five different amino acids of the kind that helped make up protein molecules were present in the meteorite.		
gene-synthesis	1970	Gene synthesis	A research team successfully synthesized a genetic molecule from scratch from independent nucleotides. This advance demonstrated the potential for creating genetic material without a pre-existing template.	Har Gobind Khorana	United States	genetic-code, protein-structure	Science: Biology	Khorana, who had worked on the genetic code (see 1961), headed a research team that in 1970 succeeded in synthesizing a genetic molecule from scratch. That is, they did not use an already existing gene as a template but began with nucleotides and put them together in the right order.		
recombinant-dna	1970	Recombinant DNA	An enzyme was discovered that could cut DNA molecules, allowing recombination of genetic fragments into new genes. This was a major step towards genetic engineering and modification.	Hamilton Othanel Smith and Daniel Nathans	United States	genetic-code	Science: Biology	In 1970 the American microbiologists Hamilton Othanel Smith (b. 1931) and Daniel Nathans (b. 1928) discovered an enzyme that could cut a molecule of DNA at certain specific sites. The resulting DNA fragments were still large enough to contain genetic information, and this work led to the formation of fragments that could recombine with each other to form new genes that did not exist in nature.		
reverse-transcriptase	1970	Reverse transcriptase	Ever since Watson and Crick worked out the structure of DNA and how it could replicate, it was thought genetic information flowed only one-way from DNA to RNA. Now an enzyme named reverse transcriptase was discovered, demonstrating the flow of genetic information from RNA back to DNA.	Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore	United States	the-double-helix	Science: Biology	Ever since Watson and Crick had worked out the structure of DNA and shown how it could replicate itself (see 1953), it had been felt (and experimental work had supported the feeling) that genetic information flowed in a one-way fashion from DNA to RNA. It usually turns out, however, that nature is more complicated than expected, and there are apparently loops in the flow that occasionally carry information from RNA back to DNA. In 1970 the American oncologist Howard Martin Temin (b. 1934), in his investigation of cancer cells, located an enzyme he called reverse transcriptase, which could affect the working of DNA in line with information received from RNA, thus making the DNA more responsive to the needs of the cell.		
megavitamin-therapy	1970	Megavitamin therapy	Megavitamin therapy proposed the use of higher vitamin doses for maintaining full health, especially vitamin C. The approach stemmed from observing that primitive diets included large quantities of vitamins.	Linus Pauling	United States	dietary-deficiency-diseases	Science: Medicine	The necessity of vitamins in the diet had been recognized since the work of Eijkman (see 1896). The dosages required appeared to be small, however—in fact, enzymatic in quantity. Then it was suggested that the tiny recommended doses were merely those required to prevent the onset of serious disease and that much higher doses were common in primitive human diets that were heavy on fruits and vegetables. It was these much higher doses that might be needed for full health, and people began to speak of megavitamin therapy.		
fiber-optics	1970	Fiber optics	Fiber optics involves using very clear glass fibers coated with plastic to conduct light waves, allowing for the transmission of vast amounts of information. This innovation paved the way for advanced communication systems by replacing copper wires with cheap glass fibers.			electric-motors, laser, celluloid	Science: Physics	Since current electricity had come into use (see 1800 and 1831), metallic wires, especially those of copper, had been used to conduct the current wherever it was needed. By 1970 techniques had been developed to conduct light by means of fine, very clear glass fibers. The fibers were coated with plastic or with a second type of glass so chosen that any light that tended to travel out of the fiber into the coating would be totally reflected. In this way, light could follow the fiber around curves and corners. With the use of lasers, such light could be as easily modulated as electric currents, so that sound waves could be converted into light of varying amplitude and, at the other end, reconverted into sound waves. Fiber optics, by replacing expensive copper with cheap glass and by using the tiny waves of light, which can carry enormous amounts of information, was instantly seen as having the potential of greatly extending communication by telephone.		
scanning-electron-microscope	1970	Scanning electron microscope	The scanning electron microscope uses a low-energy electron beam to scan surfaces, achieving three-dimensional imaging with greater magnification. It allows for detailed surface analysis and visualization of atomic positions, enhancing microscopic examination capabilities.	Albert Victor Crewe	United States	electron-microscope-improved, color-television	Science: Physics	In an ordinary electron microscope (see 1932), an electron beam, in a vacuum, passes through the sample being studied and leaves an imprint on the recording device beyond. The sample must be very thin if this is to work. If a low-energy beam of electrons is used, however, it can scan the surface of a sample much as an electron beam scans the picture tube of a television set. The electrons will induce the surface to emit electrons of its own, and these induced electrons can be detected. Such a scanning electron microscope produces a three-dimensional effect that gives more information about the surface and produces still greater magnifications than an ordinary electron microscope can do. In some cases it can even show the position of individual atoms. The first practical scanning electron microscope was built in 1970 by the British-born American physicist Albert Victor Crewe.		
planetary-soft-landing	1970	Planetary soft landing	Venera 7 achieved the first soft landing on another planet, successfully transmitting atmospheric and surface data from Venus. The unmanned Soviet moon probe Lunik 17 landed on the moon and returned safely.	(Roscosmos)	Russia	venus-lander	Space	On August 17, 1970, the Soviet Union launched Venera 7, a Venus probe that reached the planet on December 15. An instrument package was dropped into the atmosphere and made a soft landing. This was the first soft landing of any human-made object on another planet. The instruments sent back information about the atmosphere and surface for 23 minutes before the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure destroyed it.		
apollo-xiii	1970	Apollo XIII	Apollo XIII faced an emergency due to an oxygen loss in space, forcing astronauts to use the lunar module as a lifeboat. The mission's safe return demonstrated human resilience and innovation in addressing unexpected challenges in space exploration.	(NASA)	United States	space-casualties	Space	A near disaster in space took place in 1970 when Apollo XIII, en route to the Moon, underwent a loss in oxygen in the main chamber. The three astronauts crowded into the lunar module and maneuvered their way safely back to Earth.		
supersonic-transport	1970	Supersonic transport	Supersonic transport (SST) became operational in 1970, particularly in Europe and the Soviet Union. Despite technical success, they were never adopted in the US because of environmental concerns and noise issues.		England, France, Russia	supersonic-flight	Science: Engineering	In 1970 such supersonic transport (usually abbreviated SST) came into use. The United States decided not to build them for reasons of noise and environmental damage, but Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union did build them. Although they have worked well technologically, they have never proved a commercial success.		
mapping-mars	1971	Mapping mars	Mariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet, successfully mapping Mars and taking over 7000 photos. This mission revealed the planet's complex geography, including a canyon that stretched for thousands of miles Valles Marineris and a huge volcano Olympus Mons reaching 15 miles above base level.	(NASA)	United States	martian-craters	Space	On May 30, 1971, the United States launched the Mars probe Mariner 9, and on November 13, 1971, it arrived at Mars and went into orbit, the first human-made object to be placed into orbit about another planet. Mariner 9 was able to take more than seven thousand photographs of Mars, which served to map it completely. There were no canals, although there was a huge canyon stretching for thousands of miles. It was named Valles Marineris.		
moon-rocks	1971	Moon rocks	Apollo missions continued to explore the Moon, collecting samples for analysis. Apollo 14 collected 98 pounds of Moon rocks that were brought back to Earth for analysis. Apollo 15 landed a lunar rover and astronauts traveled 17 miles on the Moon's surface.	(NASA)	United States	human-beings-on-the-moon	Space	Exploration of the Moon continued in 1971. Apollo 14 reached the Moon on February 5, 1971, and its crew collected 98 pounds of Moon rocks that were brought back to Earth for analysis. They were the first samples of material collected by human beings on another world. On July 30, 1971, Apollo 15 landed on the Moon. It carried with it a lunar rover, a land vehicle designed to travel on the airless Moon. The astronauts traveled 17 miles using it and brought back more Moon rocks to Earth.		
space-station	1971	Space station	Salyut 1 marked the first space station intended for long-term human habitation. Three Soviet cosmonauts were found dead on board when Soyuz 11 returned to Earth because of air loss in the cabin.	(Roscosmos)	Russia	cosmonaut-transfer	Space	On April 19, 1971, the Soviet Union placed Salyut 1 in orbit. It was the prototype of a space station intended for long-time habitation by relay teams of cosmonauts.		
black-hole-detection	1971	Black hole detection	An X-ray-detecting satellite found evidence suggesting the presence of a black hole, Cygnus X-1, near a massive star. It was shown that the large star and black hole were revolving around each other, and that Cygnus X-1 must be 5x as massive as sun.	C. T. Bolt	Canada	x-ray-sources	Science: Astronomy	In 1971 an X-ray-detecting satellite found irregular changes in an X-ray source in the constellation of Cygnus, a source that had been named Cygnus X-1. Such irregular changes might be the result of matter circling a black hole in varying concentrations. Cygnus X-1 was at once investigated and found to exist in the immediate neighborhood of a large, hot, blue star about thirty times as massive as our Sun.		
mini-black-holes	1971	Mini-black holes	Mini-black holes formed during the big bang could still exist today, slowly evaporating over billions of years. Their potential presence offers insights into cosmic evolution and black hole properties, but they have not yet been detected.	Stephen Hawking	England	black-hole-evaporation	Science: Physics	Hawking had proposed that black holes slowly evaporated and that the evaporation increased as mass decreased (see 1970). In 1971 he pointed out that at the time of the big bang, black holes of all sizes might have been created.		
pocket-calculators	1971	Pocket calculators	The first portable calculator was introduced and used transistorized circuits to reduce size and cost. It cost only 2.5 pounds and cost just $150.	(Texas Instruments)	United States	transistorization	General	In 1971 Texas Instruments placed on sale the first calculator that was easily portable. Making use of transistorized circuits, it weighed only 2½ pounds and cost merely $150. In subsequent years, both the weight and the cost decreased dramatically.		
vitamin-b-12-synthesis	1972	Vitamin B-12 synthesis	Woodward had spent his career synthesizing increasingly complex nonpolymeric molecules, and ultimately succeeded in  synthesis of vitamin B-12 after ten years.	Robert Burns Woodward	United States	chlorophyll-synthesis	Science: Biology	Woodward (see 1944), who had spent his career synthesizing more and more complicated nonpolymeric molecules, finally spent ten years attempting the synthesis of perhaps the most complicated nonpolymeric molecule of them all—vitamin B-12. In 1972, he succeeded.		
punctuated-evolution	1972	Punctuated evolution	The concept of punctuated evolution suggests that species experience long periods of stability interrupted by rapid changes due to environmental pressures. This theory challenged previously held views on the constant rate of evolutionary change and remains under dispute.	Stephen Jay Gould, Niles Eldredge	United States	evolution-by-natural-selection	Science: Biology	Since the development of Darwin’s notion of evolution by natural selection (see 1858), the general feeling had been that evolution was a slow process but a steady one. In 1972 this view was challenged by the American paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, who suggested what they called punctuated evolution. In this view, species are stable and persist virtually unchanged for a long time. Then, certain small groups of a particular species, subjected for some reason to a special environmental pressure, change comparatively rapidly and develop into a new species. Evolution, then, is a matter of stable situations punctuated by occasional periods of rapid change.		
speed-of-light-evenson	1972	Speed of light	A research team achieved a more precise measurement of the speed of light using laser beams. This enhanced precision aids in scientific calculations and understanding of fundamental physics.	Kenneth M. Evenson	United States	speed-of-light-michelson, laser	Science: Physics	In October 1972, a research team headed by Kenneth M. Evenson, working with a chain of laser beams in Boulder, Colorado, obtained a figure for the speed of light that was far more precise than anything previously reached. He measured the speed as 186,282.3959 miles per second.		
earth-resources-satellites	1972	Earth resources satellites	Landsat 1 was launched to study the Earth's resources through large-scale photography. It offered insights into geological data and agricultural conditions, enhancing environmental and resource management.	(NASA)	United States	communications-satellites, photography, environment	Science: Geography	In 1972 the United States launched Landsat 1, the first satellite specifically designed to take large-scale photographs of Earth that would make it possible to study global resources. It provided an overview of geological data and was capable of studying forest- and grain-growing areas, yielding data on normal and abnormal growths, plant disease, and so on.		
quantum-chromodynamics	1972	Quantum Chromodynamics	By now it was understood that two quarks can form a meson, and three can form protons, neutrons, and other handrons. A theory was advanced in which there are three types of quarks dubbed red, blue, and green. Like light, a red, blue, and green quark will combine to give a lack of color (white), and only combinations yielding white can exist.	Murray Gell-Mann	United States	quarks	Science: Physics			
cat-scan	1972	CAT scan	The CAT scan was introduced, creating three-dimensional images through Computerized Axial Tomographic (CAT) scanning. which involved numerous X-ray stills that were then assembled into a 3D image. It revolutionized medical diagnosis by going beyond 2D x-rays providing detailed internal images.	Godfrey Hounsfield and Robert S. Ledley	United States	x-rays, computer	Science: Medicine	In 1972 a technique was introduced called computerized axial tomographic scanning (CAT scan), in which numerous X-ray "stills" were taken in such a way that they could be put together to form a three-dimensional image.		
laser-disks	1972	Laser disks	Laser disks became practical, using laser technology to read and store sound on disks. It significantly improved sound reproduction by utilizing digital encoding.	Klaas Compaan and Piet Kramer	Netherlands	laser, phonograph, computer	Science: Technology	In 1972 laser disks (also called compact disks) became practical. Here the sound was picked up by a laser beam, which translated it into information recorded on flat disks in the form of microscopically small pits.		
jupiter-probe	1973	Jupiter probe	Pioneer 10 was the first probe to explore the outer Solar System, successfully navigating through the asteroid belt and coming just 85,000 miles above Jupiter's surface. Jupiter is a ball of hot liquid hydrogen mixed with some helium, a constitution much like that of the Sun.	(NASA)	United States	mapping-mars	Space	On March 2, 1972, a Jupiter probe, Pioneer 10, had been launched—the first probe intended to yield information concerning the outer Solar System. After passing safely through the asteroid belt, Pioneer 10 reached the vicinity of Jupiter on December 3, 1973, and passed only 85,000 miles above Jupiter's surface, going right through the planet's magnetosphere.		
skylab	1973	Skylab	Skylab was the first American space station, 118 feet long, orbiting about 270 miles above the Earth's surface. It served as an orbital laboratory where astronauts conducted various Earth and Sun observations, with the first crew staying for 28 days, and a second staying for 60, a third for 84.	(NASA)	United States	space-station	Space	The first American orbiting object that might be considered a space station was Skylab. It was 118 feet long and was launched into orbit on May 14, 1973, about 270 miles above Earth’s surface. On May 25, three astronauts were carried to Skylab and remained on it for twenty-eight days. A second crew remained for sixty days, and a third for eighty-four days. Surveys were taken of Earth’s mineral resources and its crops and forests. Photographs of the Sun were also taken.		
origin-of-the-universe	1973	Origin of the universe	Scientists accepted the big bang, but where did the tiny body that originated the universe come from? Tryon proposed that the universe might arise from quantum fluctuations in a vacuum, adding a new perspective on the origin of the universe. 	Edward P. Tryon	United States	the-big-bang	Science: Physics	In 1973 the American physicist Edward P. Tryon pointed out that what we ordinarily think of as a vacuum is not truly a vacuum. It can give rise to sub-atomic particles that disappear before they can be detected, in accordance with quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle.		
genetic-engineering	1973	Genetic engineering	Genetic engineering began when scientists showed it was possible to insert new genes into bacteria, allowing them to reproduce the new genetic material. This offers the possibility of something as far-reaching as the ability to direct human evolution (with all the treacherous side effects that might involve).	Stanley H. Cohen, Herbert W. Boyer	United States	virus-transduction	Science: Biology	In 1973 two American biochemists, Stanley H. Cohen and Herbert W. Boyer, showed that when DNA was broken into fragments and these were combined into new genes (see 1970), the new genes could be inserted into bacterial cells, where they could be reproduced whenever the cells divided in two. This was the beginning of genetic engineering.		
proton-decay	1973	Proton decay	Since the unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions, physicists had been working on integrating strong interactions as well into a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). As part of this research, it was proposed that protons may decay with a very large half life of 10^31 years, but no proof of this has been found yet.	Abdus Salam		electroweak-interaction, quantum-chromodynamics	Science: Physics	Since the successful unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions (see 1968), physicists such as Glashow had been attempting to include the strong interaction as well under the umbrella of a single set of equations. This was being done, though it required several sets of modifications to make such a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) work, and it is still not entirely satisfactory today. In 1973 Abdus Salam suggested that such a theory might imply that the proton was very slightly unstable.		
mapping-of-mercury	1974	Mapping of mercury	Mariner 10's mission came within 500 miles of Mercury's surface, provided a detailed mapping ofthe planet, confirming its rotation rate, temperature, and lack of significant atmosphere, and also detecting a faint magnetic field.	(NASA)	United States	rotation-of-mercury	Space	Mariner 10 had been launched on November 3, 1973. On February 5, 1974, it passed by Venus just 3,600 miles above its cloud layer and then headed for Mercury. On March 19, 1974, it passed within 435 miles of Mercury's surface. It moved into an orbit about the Sun in such a way that it passed near Mercury a second and third time. On the third approach, it passed within 200 miles of Mercury's surface. Mariner 10 confirmed Mercury's rotation rate and temperature and showed that it had no satellite and no significant atmosphere. It determined the diameter, mass, and density of Mercury with greater precision than had been possible before. In addition, it allowed about three-eighths of Mercury's surface to be mapped. The photographs it took of Mercury showed a landscape that looked very much like that of the Moon. There were craters everywhere, the largest being 125 miles in diameter. Mercury is not as rich in "seas" as the Moon is. The largest one sighted is about 870 miles across and is called Caloris (heat). Mercury also has cliffs that are a couple of hundred miles long and about 1 1/2 miles high. In addition Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury		
formation-of-the-moon	1974	Formation of the moon	A new theory proposed that a Mars-sized planet collided with Earth, forming the Moon from Earth's outer layers. This theory is a favored explanation due to computer simulations supporting its feasibility.	William K. Hartmann	United States		Space	In 1974, American astronomer William K. Hartmann suggested that a planet the size of Mars had a glancing collision with Earth in the early days of the Solar System, forming the Moon from Earth's outer layers while the cores merged.		
leda	1974	Leda	A thirteenth Jovian satellite was discovered, later named Leda, among Jupiter's outer group of satellites. It is only 5 miles across.	Charles T. Kowall	United States	jupiter-xii	Space	On September 10, 1974, the American astronomer Charles T. Kowall detected a thirteenth satellite of Jupiter, named Leda, among the outermost satellites.		
freon-and-the-ozone-layer	1974	Freon and the ozone layer	Freon, used in various consumer products, contained chlorofluorocarbons that were later found to damage the ozone layer. This discovery led to increased awareness of environmental safety concerning chemical usage.	F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina	United States	freon, environment	Science: Environmental	Freon, initially introduced by Midgley in 1930 and used in air-conditioning and spray cans, contained compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, which seemed safe but later were found to harm the ozone layer.		
tauon	1974	Tauon	The tauon is a type of lepton found when electrons and positrons collide at high energies. It is 17 times as massive as a muon and 3500 times more massive than an electron, lasting less than five trillionth of a second before breaking down into a muon.	Martin L. Perl	United States	kaons-and-hyperons	Science: Physics	In 1974 the American physicist Martin L. Perl found that when electrons and positrons (antielectrons) were smashed together at high energies, still a third variety of lepton was produced. This was named the tau electron, or in shorter version, the tauon. It presumably has a neutrino of its own, and there is surely an antiparticle for each, so that twelve leptons are now known. The tauon is about 17 times as massive as the muon and about 3,500 times as massive as the electron. It is very unstable and lasts less than five-trillionths of a second before breaking down to a muon.		
charmed-quarks	1974	Charmed quarks	By now three kinds of quarks were known: up, down, and strange. But the theory predicted that quarks should exist in pairs, with up-down and strange-charmed proposed as a pairing. Using the latest particle accelerators, a hadron that had to contain a charmed quark was created. The third pair of quarks is the top-bottom, for a total of six quarks and six antiquarks (matching the number of leptons)	Burton Richter, Samuel Chao Chung Ting	United States	quantum-chromodynamics	Science: Physics	In 1974 the American physicist Burton Richter, using the enormous energies of the latest particle accelerators, produced a particle that, from its properties, had to include a c-quark in its makeup. Another American physicist, Samuel Chao Chung Ting, working independently, also produced a particle that had to contain a c-quark. The two shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1976.		
microchips	1975	Microchips	Since the introduction in 1948 transistors have becoming smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. By 1975 they became so powerful they enabled personal computers, foreshadowing word processors and robots.			transistorization	Science: Technology	Since transistors had first been developed (see 1948), they had been made steadily smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. By 1975 they had become so small, and the circuits upon them had been etched in so compact a manner, that they could be called microchips. This meant that computers also could be made very small, very cheap, and very powerful. And this made possible personal computers, the first of which were introduced in 1975, foreshadowing the coming of word-processors and robots. With the microchip, the computer was no longer suitable only for government and large industries. It began to invade the domain of the general public.		
surface-of-venus	1975	Surface of Venus	The Soviet probes Venera 9 and Venera 10 successfully landed on Venus and captured photographs of its rocky surface. This achievement demonstrated that light could penetrate Venus's cloud layer, allowing for photography.	(Roscosmos)	Soviet Union	venuss-atmosphere	Space	In 1975 the Soviet probes Venera 9 and Venera 10 managed to make successful soft landings on the planet Venus and to endure long enough to take photographs of a rocky surface. It was clear that sufficient light penetrated the cloud layer to make photographs possible.		
endorphins	1975	Endorphins	Compounds called endorphins were discovered in the nervous system that alleviate pain by interacting with pain receptors. Endorphins may someday be used in pain control without the addictive qualities and other side effects of opiates.	John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz	England		Science: Biology	It was discovered in 1975 that the nervous system gives rise to compounds that alleviate pain. These consist of short chains of amino acids that seem to interact with the pain-receptors. Presumably, morphine and similar opiates work by mimicking the action of these substances, which are now called endorphins.		
life-on-mars	1976	Life on Mars	The Viking probes were launched to explore Mars and provided the best photographs of its surface. They found no visible signs of life, but discovered dry riverbeds indicating a past presence of water.	(NASA)	United States	venuss-atmosphere, photography	Space	In 1975 two Mars probes had been launched by the United States, Viking 1 on August 20 and Viking 2 on September 9. Both went into orbit about Mars in mid-1976, and they took the best photographs of the Martian surface yet. On July 20, 1976, Viking 1 came down to the Martian surface at what would have been, on Earth, the edge of the tropical zone. Some weeks later Viking 2 came down in a more northerly position. In coming down, they discovered that the Martian atmosphere, though chiefly carbon dioxide, was also 2.7 percent nitrogen and 1.6 percent argon. The Martian surface was rocky, as Earth’s surface is. The Martian surface, however, was richer in iron and sulfur and poorer in aluminum, sodium, and potassium. There was no sign of life on Mars on a scale visible to the eye. The Viking probes were equipped to run experiments on Martian soil to see if any microscopic forms of life were present. The experiments were carried through with ambiguous results, but there was no trace of organic material in the soil, and this led astronomers to believe that certain lifelike responses to the experiments were the result of some odd chemical behavior of the soil. There were signs of dry riverbeds, however, complete with tributaries. It may be that in ages past there was a reasonable supply of liquid water on Mars. If so, where did it go, and what led to such an extreme cooling of the planet?		
pluto-surface	1976	Pluto’s Surface	Pluto is normally the furthest planet from the sun, but at perehelion it is a little closer to us than Neptune is. The spectrum of light it reflected was studied and it was decided that Pluto's surface was covered with frozen methane.	(NASA)	United States	pluto	Space			
synthetic-gene	1977	Synthetic gene	A synthetic gene was successfully placed inside a living cell where it functioned properly. This validated scientific conclusions about gene structure.	Har Gobind Khorana	United States		Science: Biology	Khorana had synthesized a gene (see 1970). Now he went a step further and placed a synthetic gene inside a living cell. There it proved perfectly capable of functioning. This was the final proof (if any were needed) that the scientific conclusions about the structure of the gene were valid.		
string-theory	1976	String theory	Conceptual development of string theory suggested one-dimensional strings formed as the universe cooled after the big bang. They would contain massive energies and gravitational fields, but lack observational evidence.			origin-of-the-universe	Science: Physics	Suggestions were made in 1976 to the effect that, as the Universe cooled in the first instants after the big bang, flaws or creases would have appeared in the structure of space. These would form long one-dimensional strings containing huge masses, energies, and gravitational fields. Such thoughts persist, but observational evidence for the existence of such strings has not yet been obtained.		
rings-of-uranus	1977	Rings of Uranus	The rings of Uranus were discovered when Uranus occulted a star. To minimize distortions from the lower atmosphere, observations from a high flying airplane captured how starlight dimmed, revealing the presence of rings. Saturn's position as the unique posessor of rings was lost.	James L. Elliot	United States	saturn-ring, jet-planes	Space	On March 10, 1977, the planet Uranus moved in front of a ninth-magnitude star in the constellation of Libra. This occultation was observed by the American astronomer James L. Elliot from an airplane that took him high enough to minimize the distorting and obscuring effects of the lower atmosphere. The idea was to observe how the starlight dimmed as the atmosphere of Uranus approached the star and		
chiron	1977	Chiron	Chiron was identified as a distant celestial object with an elliptical orbit between Uranus and Saturn. Completing one turn around the sun every 50 years, it is considered an asteroid but is the farthest one discovered at that time.	Charles T. Kowall	United States	pluto	Space	On November 1, 1977, Kowall, the discoverer of Jupiter XIII, was studying photographic plates, searching for asteroids in Jupiter's orbit. He detected something that might have been such an asteroid, but it was moving at only one-third the speed that would have associated it with Jupiter's orbit. It had to be somewhere in the neighborhood of Uranus. Eventually Kowall worked out its orbit and found that it followed a markedly elliptical path that carried it out as far as Uranus at one end and as close as Saturn at the other, completing one turn about the Sun every 50.7 years. It seemed to be an asteroid, but it was the farthest one yet discovered, and by far. It was named Chiron, after the most famous centaur in Greek mythology.		
inflationary-universe	1977	Inflationary universe	The inflationary universe theory suggests a rapid expansion of the universe moments after the big bang. This concept helps explain certain characteristics unexplained by the classical big bang theory.	Alan Guth	United States	the-big-bang, proton-decay	Science: Physics	The concept of the big bang did not answer all questions. In 1977 the American physicist Alan Guth suggested that, from the equations developed for the Grand Unified Theory, it could be argued that the Universe, in the instants after the big bang, underwent a sudden and exceedingly rapid inflation. This period of expansion can be used to explain some characteristics of the Universe that the classical big bang theory cannot, but the details are elusive, and the concept of an inflationary universe is still being worked on by cosmogonists.		
vela-pulsar	1977	Vela pulsar	A second optical pulsar was discovered in the Vela nebula, expanding the known examples beyond the Crab nebula. This pulsar is believed to be a remnant of an old supernova.			optical-pulsars	Space	For nine years, the pulsar at the center of the Crab nebula had been the only optical pulsar known. In 1977 a second optical pulsar was discovered, in the Vela nebula, which seems also to be the remnant of an old supernova explosion.		
deep-sea-ecosystems	1977	Deep-sea ecosystems	Ocean vents spewing mineral-rich hot water into the ocean were discovered. These vents host unique ecosystems with bacteria which require neither oxygen, light, nor photosyntheses.	Robert Ballard	United States	bathyscaphe, deep-sea-life	Science: Biology	In 1977 it was discovered that there were ocean vents, or “chimneys,” that continually spewed hot water laden with minerals into the ocean.		
lucy	1977	Lucy discovery	A hominid fossil named Lucy was discovered, revealing insights into early human bipedalism. This discovery helps differentiate human ancestors from apes.	Donald Johanson	United States	homo-habilis	Science: Anthropology	Donald Johanson discovered a hominid fossil named Lucy, identified as Australopithecus afarensis, approximately four million years old. Lucy was bipedal, indicating early human-like locomotion.		
nonbacterial-dna	1977	Nonbacterial DNA	Bacterial DNA, which is easy to work with, is densely packed with meaningful genes. However DNA in non-bacterial cells was found to have many "introns", or non-functional sections. This discovery raises questions about the purpose of noncoding DNA.	Richard Roberts and Phil Sharp	United States	genetic-code	Science: Genetics	It was discovered that the DNA in nonbacterial cells is not densely packed with genes, unlike bacterial DNA. Much of nonbacterial DNA consists of sequences that appear non-functional.		
smallpox-eradication	1977	Smallpox eradication	Smallpox was officially eradicated, marking a major milestone in medical history. The disease’s extinction showcases the success of global vaccination efforts. 			smallpox-vaccine	Science: Medicine	In 1977, the last case of smallpox was recorded in Somalia. This marked the end of smallpox as a naturally occurring contagious disease.		
aids	1977	Aids emergence	AIDS was identified in New York, marking its emergence as a global health crisis. The disease is characterized by a severely compromised immune system.		United States		Science: Medicine	In 1977, a rare form of cancer linked to AIDS was identified in homosexual men in New York City. AIDS is an incurable disease that spread rapidly and became highly feared in the 1980s.		
fiber-optic-communication	1977	Fiber optic communication	Fiber optics were successfully tested for telephone communication, showcasing rapid data transmission capabilities. This innovation paved the way for modern telecommunication advancements.		United States	fiber-optics	Science: Technology	Fiber optics, initially developed in 1970, were used experimentally in telephone systems in 1977 and proved effective within a decade.		
balloon-angioplasty	1977	Balloon angioplasty	Balloon angioplasty allows the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis by widening arteries using balloons. This nonsurgical technique became a popular alternative to bypass operations.			coronary-bypass-surgery	Science: Medicine	Coronary atherosclerosis could now be treated by performing bypass operations (see 1969). An alternative, nonsurgical technique was developed in 1977. This called for tiny balloons being led into the affected arteries by means of catheters. The balloons then expanded and pressed back the plaques, widening the bore of the arteries. Such balloon angioplasty slowly became more popular as an alternative to bypass operations.		
radar-mapping-of-venus	1978	Radar mapping of Venus	Radar mapping by Pioneer Venus provided valuable data about Venus's atmosphere and surface. It revealed the composition of its atmosphere (mostly carbon dioxide, some nitrogen) and the existence of a supercontinent and plateau regions.	(NASA)	United States	surface-of-venus	Space	The United States launched Pioneer Venus on May 20, 1978, and it went into orbit about Venus on December 4, 1978. It sent several probes into Venus’s atmosphere and found that the cloud layer contained droplets of sulfuric acid, that about 2.5 percent of the sunlight striking the cloud layer penetrated to the surface of the planet, and that the atmosphere was 96.6 percent carbon dioxide and 3.2 percent nitrogen. In view of its density, that meant Venus’s atmosphere had more than three times as much nitrogen as Earth’s. Venus Pioneer also beamed radar waves at Venus, and from the reflections, details of the surface (otherwise invisible from outside the cloud layer) could be determined.		
charon	1978	Charon	A distinct lump observed in Pluto's photographs was identified as its satellite, Charon. This discovery contributed significantly to understanding Pluto's composition and celestial positioning. Pluto was measured to be about 2000 miles in diameter, and Charon 750 miles, forming something like a double planet.	James W. Christy	United States	pluto	Space	On June 22, 1978, the American astronomer James W. Christy, examining photographs of Pluto, noted a distinct lump on one side. He checked other photographs and found that the lump shifted position. Finally he decided it was a satellite.		
oncogenes	1978	Oncogenes	Oncogenes, genes that can transform normal cells into cancerous cells, were identified. The oncogene was found to be very similar to a normal gene, differing in a single amino acid. 	Robert A. Weinberg	United States	genetic-code, tumor-virus	Science: Biology	In 1978 the American scientist Robert A. Weinberg and his colleagues successfully produced tumors in mice by the transfer of individual genes. The genes concerned were called oncogenes, the prefix being the one commonly used in medical terminology for 'tumor.' The oncogene was found to be very similar to a normal gene.		
virus-genome	1978	Virus genome	The SV40 virus genome was sequenced, marking progress toward understanding gene structures. This advancement laid groundwork for future human genome research.			genetic-code	Science: Biology	In 1978 the first step was taken in this direction when the genome of a virus called SV40 was determined. This points the way, ultimately, to the working out of the human genome.		
test-tube-baby	1978	Test-tube baby	The first baby conceived via in vitro fertilization (IVF) was born. This breakthrough provided new reproductive options for couples experiencing infertility.		England		Science: Biology	On July 25, 1978, a normal baby was born in Great Britain of an egg that had been fertilized by sperm in the glassware of a laboratory rather than within the mother’s body. Such a test-tube baby offers a way for couples to have children when, for one reason or another, fertilization within the body cannot take place.		
jupiters-satellites	1979	Jupiter's satellites	Probes Voyager I and Voyager 2 provided the first close observations of Jupiter's four major satellites, revealing unique geological features like Io's active volcanoes and Europa's smooth surface. The mission also led to the discovery of three new satellites and a thin ring around Jupiter.	(NASA)	United States	leda	Space	The probes Voyager I and Voyager 2 passed by Jupiter in March and July, respectively, of 1979. The most interesting result was that they gave humanity its first close look at the four Galilean satellites. The satellites are subject to tidal heating from Jupiter, a heating that increases rapidly as distance from Jupiter decreases. Thus, Ganymede and Callisto, the outermost pair, are both covered with craters as might be expected and seem to be made up largely of icy material. Europa, second-closest to Jupiter, is smooth and criss-crossed with lines, apparently covered with a liquid-water glacier. Io, the closest of the four, has no water at all and exhibits active volcanoes. Io's surface is covered by a yellow to red layer of sulfur. Three more small satellites and a thin ring of debris were discovered, making sixteen satellites for Jupiter.		
extinction-of-the-dinosaurs	1979	Extinction of the dinosaurs	Research identified a layer of rock with high iridium concentrations dating to sixty-five million years ago, hinting at a massive asteroid impact linked to the extinction of dinosaurs. This discovery provided substantial evidence for the theory of an impact event leading to a mass extinction.	Walter Alvarez	United States		Science: Geology	In 1979, the American scientist Walter Alvarez was trying to establish sedimentation rates in old sedimentary rocks in Italy using neutron-activation techniques. He discovered a narrow layer of rock with unusually high iridium concentrations, suggesting that it originated from a massive celestial impact. This layer dated to sixty-five million years ago, coinciding with the extinction of the dinosaurs and other species at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.		
gluons	1979	Gluons	The discovery of gluons provided evidence for the particles responsible for the strong nuclear force binding quarks together. This finding was crucial in advancing the understanding of particle physics and the fundamental forces.	Sau Lan Wu and Georg Zobernig	Germany	strong-interaction, quarks	Science: Physics	Quarks are held together by the strong interaction, which must involve an exchange particle called gluons. Energetic subatomic-particle interactions in 1979 produced rudimentary indications of the production of gluons.		
saturnian-system	1980	Saturnian system	The Voyager probes investigated Saturn's moons, revealing Titan's atmosphere to be mostly nitrogen, not methane as previously thought. Mimas has a huge crator that must have nearly shattered the moon, Iapetus has one hemisphere much darker than the other. An additional eight satellites were found bringing the total to seventeen.	(NASA)	United States	jupiters-satellites, communications-satellites, photography	Space	The probe Voyager 1 passed by Saturn on November 12, 1980. Voyager 2 followed not long after. A number of the satellites of Saturn were for the first time seen as more than points of light. Titan, the largest satellite, was known to have an atmosphere of methane, but methane turned out to be present in small quantities compared to nitrogen. The Titanian atmosphere turned out to be 98 percent nitrogen and 2 percent methane and may be thicker than Earth's atmosphere. The Saturn probes succeeded in finding eight satellites that were too small to be seen from Earth, bringing the total number to seventeen. Two satellites inside Mimas’s orbit are unusual in being co-orbital. The Saturnian rings were also found to be far more complex than had been thought.		
neutrino-mass	1980	Neutrino mass	Previously thought to be massless, experiments showed that neutrinos have small masses. If so, the three neutrinos – electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tauon-neutrino might be capable of oscillating, which would explain why the sun emits only a third the number of neutrinos it ought to.	Frederick Reines	United States	solar-neutrinos	Science: Physics	In 1980 Frederick Reines (see 1956) reported on experiments that indicated neutrinos might have tiny quantities of mass (for years they had been thought to be massless). Researchers in Moscow reported similar results in an entirely different experiment and thought the neutrino mass might be 1/13,000 of an electron. If this were so, then the three neutrinos—the electron-neutrino, the muon-neutrino, and the tauon-neutrino—might well have slightly different masses and be capable of oscillating; that is, of continually changing from one to another.		
space-shuttle	1981	Space shuttle	Until now, all space vessels had been one-time operations. The space shuttle is a reusable spacecraft developed by NASA to enter orbit and return to Earth. The first Shuttle, Columbia, launched on April 12, 1981, exactly two decades after Gagarin's maiden voyage.	(NASA)	United States	multiperson-spaceflight	Space	NASA developed its concept of a reusable space vehicle during the 1960s and 1970s, and the first shuttle, "Columbia," was launched in 1981. All went well until the disastrous 25th mission in 1986, when the shuttle "Challenger" exploded soon after liftoff with the loss of seven lives. Flights were resumed three years later after a redesign of the solid-fuel booster rockets, which had caused the disaster. At liftoff, the shuttle fires its main engines and the pair of solid-fuel boosters, which together give it a thrust of more than 3,300 tons. When after two minutes the boosters have burned out, they are jettisoned and parachuted down for recovery and reuse. Meanwhile the vehicle continues to accelerate for a further six minutes on its three main liquid-fuel (hydrogen/oxygen) engines. After these engines cut off, the main fuel tank is jettisoned and maneuver motors steer the shuttle into orbit at a height of 150 miles. At the completion of the space mission—which can last as long as ten days—the shuttle reenters the Earth’s atmosphere by firing its retrorockets. After a temporary communications blackout as the heat-shield tiles glow white hot, the craft glides down in a series of S-turns before making an unpowered automatic landing.		
neptunes-rings	1982	Neptune's rings	Neptune's rings were discovered by observing irregularities in star occultation patterns, similar to the discovery of the rings of Uranus. It was suggested that Neptune's rings are arcs of material, and do not fully encircle the planet.	(NASA)	United States	rings-of-uranus	Space	The rings of Uranus had been discovered by the behavior of a star's light, which disappeared and reappeared as Uranus approached it and then left it. In 1981 similar phenomena were noted when Neptune passed in front of a star. But the pattern had been symmetrical as the star passed into and out of occultation with Uranus, and in the case of Neptune it was not. The suggestion was therefore made that Neptune did not have symmetrical rings but merely arcs of ring material that did not stretch all the way around the planet.		
millisecond-pulsar	1982	Millisecond pulsar	A new type of millisecond pulsar was discovered, rotating 642 times faster than the fastest previously known pulsar. It likely gained speed by absorbing matter from a companion in a binary system.	Donald Charles Backer	United States	optical-pulsars	Space	The fastest pulsar known was in the Crab nebula and rotated some 30 times a second, emitting pulses at that rate. In 1982, however, a pulsar was found that rotated more than twenty times as fast, at 642 times per second. Moreover, it did not show signs of being a particularly young pulsar. There was a suggestion that it was part of a double star system and that, by absorbing matter from its companion, it had gained angular momentum and speeded up.		
magnetic-monopoles	1982	Magnetic monopoles	Why is it that electricity can exist as a negative or positive charge, but magnetism is always paired with north and south poles? A setup was created to detect magnetic monopoles by producing an electric current as they passed through. This single detection has never been reproduced, so the existence of monopoles remains in question.	Blas Cabrera	United States	proton-decay	Science: Physics	Therefore, the physicist Blas Cabrera devised a setup that would produce an electric current if a magnetic monopole were to pass through it, and on February 14, 1982, it produced such a current. That single detection has not yet been repeated, however, either by Cabrera or by anyone else, so the existence of the magnetic monopole remains in question.		
jarvik-hearts	1982	Jarvik hearts	The Jarvik heart the best available implantable artificial heart, which was implanted into a retired dentist, where it sustained his life for 112 days. Still this was unsatisfactory because it required a large energy source, limiting the patient's mobility.	Robert K. Jarvik	United States	artificial-heart-implant	Science: Medicine	Artificial pumps to replace the human heart, at least temporarily, had been attempted (see 1969), but the best so far was devised by an American physician, Robert K. Jarvik (b. 1946). On December 1, 1982, a Jarvik heart was placed into the chest of a retired dentist, Barney Clark, who lived 112 days with it. Other patients were later similarly treated. On the whole, though, the Jarvik heart was unsatisfactory. It required an outside energy source, so the patient was not freely mobile, and the quality of life was in general poor.		
laser-printers	1982	Laser printers	Early printers were automatic typewriters, noisily typing about a line per second. Laser printers were introduced by IBM, offering silent printing and increased speed of 30 lines per second. This innovation marked a significant advancement in printing technology.	Gary Starkweather	United States	typewriters, computer	Design	The first printers developed for word-processors were essentially automatic typewriters that typed about a line per second and were as noisy as typewriters. In 1982 IBM put laser printers on the market. They printed silently and did some 30 lines per second.		Unclear why this is 1982
w-particles	1983	W particles	The electroweak theory predicted three exchange particles, W+, W- and Z0 (neutral), which were 80x as massive as protons and took a large amount of energy to form. An experiment formed them all and found the particles had the expected mass, confirming the electroweak theory.	Carlo Rubbia, Simon van der Meer	Italy and Netherlands	electroweak-interaction	Science: Physics	The electroweak theory made it necessary for the weak interaction to involve three exchange particles, one positive (W+), one negative (W-), and one neutral (Z0). By 1983, physicists were able to detect all three particles, confirming their predicted mass. This proved key aspects of the electroweak theory. The experiments were conducted by Italian physicist Carlo Rubbia and Dutch physicist Simon van der Meer.		
extrasolar-planets	1983	Extrasolar planets	IRAS, an infrared satellite, picked up IR radiation from the Vega neighborhood, which was interpreted as a ring of planets around that star. This was the best evidence yet of extrasolar planets.	(NASA, NIVR, SERC)	United States, Netherlands, and England	x-ray-sources	Space	IRAS, a satellite designed to detect infrared radiation, picked up such radiation in the immediate neighborhood of the bright star Vega in 1983. It suggested that a ring of particles, resembling an asteroid belt, might surround the star. This was then interpreted as evidence that other stars might possess planets.		
nuclear-winter	1983	Nuclear winter	Nuclear winter theory suggests that nuclear explosions could cause severe climate disruptions by reducing sunlight. The concept stresses the devastating global effects of nuclear war.	Carl Sagan	England	environment, extinction-of-the-dinosaurs, nuclear-fission-bomb	Science: Environmental	Speculative accounts of a comet strike on Earth sixty-five million years ago, which might have ended the dinosaurs, inspired thoughts on nuclear war. A group proposed that nuclear explosions could generate enough dust to cause a nuclear winter, affecting global climates and leading to mass starvation.		
dna-and-human-evolution	1984	Dna and human evolution	DNA analysis suggested that humans and chimpanzees have a closer evolutionary relationship than either has to gorillas or orangutans. This finding implies that humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor approximately five to six million years ago.			evolution-and-mutation, lucy	Science: Biology	DNA molecules change with time, forming mutations (see 1937). Presumably, if the DNA molecules of two different species are compared, then the more closely related the species are, the fewer the differences. And from the number of differences, one can tell, perhaps, the length of time it has taken the two species to differentiate from a common ancestor. Since the mutations are the result of chance changes, conclusions cannot be drawn with mathematical certainty, but they are suggestive. In 1984 such DNA analysis was used to present reasons for supposing that human beings and chimpanzees were more closely related to each other, evolutionarily, than either was to gorillas or orangutans, and that human beings and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor some five to six million years ago.		
brown-dwarfs	1984	Brown dwarfs	A dim companion star to the red dwarf Van Biesbroeck 8 was found, believed to be a brown dwarf. Brown dwarfs are celestial objects that glow faintly without undergoing nuclear fusion like regular stars.	(NASA)	United States	white-dwarfs	Space	In 1984 the red dwarf star Van Biesbroeck 8 was reported to have a still dimmer companion star. The companion was so small and dim that it seemed it could not be massive enough, or bright enough, to be shining by ordinary nuclear fusion. It was moderately heated to the point of just glowing, and it gave off radiation rich in infrared, by other types of nuclear reactions, perhaps. If it were totally cold and didn’t radiate in the visible region at all, it would be a black dwarf. Since it wasn’t totally cold, it was called a brown dwarf. The existence of this particular brown dwarf was later disputed, but other examples were reported.		
ozone-hole	1985	Ozone hole	A significant hole in the Antarctic ozone layer was discovered, confirming the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons. This finding underscored the environmental damage caused by these chemicals.	Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin	England	freon-and-the-ozone-layer, earth-resources-satellites	Science: Environmental Science	A hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic was detected by the British Antarctic survey, and the ozone concentration elsewhere was abnormally low. This was taken as disturbing confirmation of the deleterious effect of chlorofluorocarbons on ozone (see 1974).		
pluto-and-charon	1985	Pluto and charon	Observations of Charon moving in front of and behind Pluto revealed new information about their surfaces, suggesting that Charon's surface was frozen water.	(NASA)	United States	charon	Space	In 1985 Charon, which had been discovered near perihelion (see 1978), began to move in front of Pluto on the way to moving behind it. By studying the light of Pluto alone, when Charon was behind it, and the light from both bodies, when Charon was in front of it but not covering all of it, something could be deduced about the surfaces of the two bodies.		
uranus-probe	1986	Uranus probe	Voyager 2 provided the first close examination of Uranus, revealing its rotation period of 17.24 hours and a magnetic field tilted at 60 degrees to its rotational exis. 	(NASA)	United States	uranus	Space	On January 24, 1986, Voyager 2 flew past Uranus and gave humanity its first close look at that distant planet discovered by Herschel (see 1781), as well as its rings and satellites. Uranus was found to rotate in 17.24 hours (previous estimates had been anywhere from 10 to 25 hours). It had, as expected, a magnetic field, but one that was tilted 60 degrees to the rotational axis. Uranus’s rings, detected from Earth nine years earlier, were confirmed. The five known satellites turned out to be somewhat larger than had been thought, and no fewer than ten small satellites were found to be circling at a smaller distance than that of Miranda, the already-known satellite nearest to Uranus. Miranda was particularly astonishing. It was only 300 miles in diameter, so it could not have had enough internal heat to power geological change. Nevertheless, it had a veritable jumble of different surface features. It is thought that bombardment in its early days may have broken it into fragments that since then have coalesced every which way.		
halley-comet-iii	1986	Halley's comet	Halley's comet returned for the third time since Halley first worked out its orbit in 1705. An ESA probe named Giotto after the first man to paint the comet in 1304, made a close approach. The comet turned out to be dirtier and larger than expected.	(ESA)	International	halley-comet, comet-painting, sputnik	Space	Halley’s comet returned for the third time since Halley had first worked out its orbit (see 1705). Its appearance in 1986 was unfortunately not a showy one, since it remained rather far from Earth even at its closest approach and could only be seen high in the sky from the southern hemisphere. It was an unprecedented return, however, since it could now be studied by probes sent out by the Soviet Union and by the European Space Agency. The European probe, named Giotto (after the painter who had been the first to paint the comet realistically—see 1304), made the closest approach. Comets had been pictured as "dirty snowballs" by Whipple (see 1949), and he was shown to be right, but Halley’s comet turned out to be far dirtier than expected. While it lost ice each time it approached the Sun, it lost rocky particles to a much smaller extent and they accumulated on the surface, forming a kind of crust, through which the vapors formed by heated ice broke through at weak spots here and there. The result was that Halley’s comet was dark black in color. This meant it was larger than expected. Since it reflected so little light, a larger surface was required to produce its observed brightness.		
magellanic-supernova	1987	Magellanic supernova	The last visible supernova was studied by Kepler in 1604. The rest of them were too far away until a nearby supernova was caught in the Large Magellanic Cloud 150,000 lightyears away. The explosion was heralded by a spray of neutrinos caught in recently devised neutrino telescopes, and a pulsar at the center reported.			supernovas	Space	The last supernova that had been visible in our own Milky Way Galaxy was one studied by Kepler in 1604. Since then, the nearest supernova had been one spied 2,300,000 light-years away in the Andromeda galaxy (see 1886), but at the time it was not known to be a supernova and was not carefully studied even with the instruments then available. Since then, the only supernovas to have been noted had been in still more distant galaxies. In February 1987, however, a supernova was caught in its early explosive stage in the Large Magellanic Cloud. That was not in our own galaxy to be sure, but it was in the galaxy closest to our own, only 150,000 light-years away. The explosion had been heralded by a spray of neutrinos, some of which were caught in recently devised neutrino telescopes. Undoubtedly, as more and better instruments of the sort are built, the sky will be regularly scanned for neutrinos that may herald supernova explosions. The Magellanic supernova was carefully studied as the light built up and faded and as the nebulosity about it expanded and thinned. In 1988 the expected appearance of a pulsar at its center rotating two thousand times per second was reported.		
warm-superconductivity	1987	Warm superconductivity	Superconductivity was observed in ceramic substances at 30° K, causing major excitement in the scientific community. This discovery led to intense research on ceramics, though theoretical explanations and practical applications remain challenging.	Johannes Georg Bednorz	Germany	superconductivity	Science: Physics	Johannes Georg Bednorz, studying ceramic substances (mixtures of metallic oxides) rather than metals, found they were obtaining superconductivity at temperatures of 30° K. This broke with shattering impact on the scientific community. Everyone began studying ceramics, and superconductivity in the liquid nitrogen temperature range was obtained. The difficulties that remain are that no good theoretical explanation of this astonishing behavior of ceramics exists, so that it is still a matter of "cookbook chemistry," as properties vary erratically from one ceramic to another and from one batch of a particular ceramic to another. Then too, ceramics are not easy to form into film or wire, so that much must be done before technological applications can be made. Nevertheless, Mueller and Bednorz, without delay, shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1987.		
distant-galaxies-detection	1988	Distant galaxies detection	Advanced technology enabled the detection of galaxies with extreme red shifts, indicating they might be seventeen billion light-years away. This suggested the universe must be older than previously thought.			gravitational-red-shift	Space	New instruments and computerized techniques made it possible to detect galaxies with red shifts greater than any previously seen; greater even than those of quasars. In 1988 some were detected that might be as much as seventeen billion light-years away. This was important with respect to the birth of the Universe. If the galaxies were seventeen billion light-years away, it had taken their light seventeen billion years to reach us, and we were seeing them as they existed seventeen billion years ago. This meant that even seventeen billion years ago the Universe was old enough to have formed galaxies.		
shroud-of-turin	1988	Shroud of Turin	The Shroud of Turin, a famous piece of linen with an image showing an bearded, long haired man, was tested using carbon-14 dating. This proved that it originated from the 1300s, overturning the belief that it was the burial shroud of Jesus Christ.		England	carbon-14-dating	Science	The Shroud of Turin is a linen cloth that seems to possess an image, front and back, of a bearded, long-haired man, which resembles the popular conception of Jesus. It was first displayed in France in the 1350s and in 1578 was taken to Turin, Italy. Many people believed it to be the burial sheet of Jesus with the image produced by miraculous means. Others, more skeptical, assumed it to be a forgery produced not long before it was first shown. In 1988 some of the linen was finally tested by the carbon-14 dating method worked out by Libby (see 1947). The results were clear. The linen had been part of living flax plants seven hundred years ago. The shroud, and presumably the image upon it, had been produced not long before it was first displayed and was thirteen centuries too late to have been the shroud of Jesus.		
greenhouse-effect-effects	1988	Greenhouse effect	The intensifying greenhouse effect was causing rising global temperatures and environmental crises, with the yearly warming and disastrous droughts. Rising temperatures could also promote the melting of Earth's ice caps to produce sea level rise, threatening the habitability of our planet.			greenhouse-effect, environment	Science: Climate	It had been known since Arrhenius (see 1884) had pointed it out that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere acted as a heat trap, making Earth's temperature warmer than it would otherwise be. This was called the greenhouse effect. It was also known that the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere had been rising steadily since 1900, partly because of the increasing use of coal and oil, which produce carbon dioxide when burned, and partly because of the cutting down of forests, which are the most efficient consumers of carbon dioxide. As it happened, 1987 was the warmest year yet recorded by weather bureaus, and 1988 was warmer still. What's more, 1988 saw disastrous droughts in the United States and elsewhere. There was a feeling that the greenhouse effect was intensifying, and world concern began to intensify accordingly. Rising temperatures would not only alter Earth's climate (probably for the worse) but could promote the melting of Earth's ice caps to produce a disastrous rise in sea level of up to 200 feet. The greenhouse effect, plus the thinning of the ozone layer, the steady rise in environmental pollution, and the inexorable increase in population, seemed to have placed the very habitability of our planet at risk, and a sense of crisis was beginning to pervade the world.		
neptune-and-triton	1989	Neptune and triton	Voyager 2 flew within 3000 miles of Neptune's surface, revealing that it rotates every 16.1 hours. Discoveries include Neptune's strong winds up to 1500 mph, a magnetic field that is shifted 50 degrees in relation to its rotational axis. Neptune's largest moon Triton was found to be surprisingly cold at a 40°K surface temperature.	(NASA)	United States	neptunes-rings	Space	On August 25, Voyager 2 flew within 3,000 miles of the pale-blue-gas giant Neptune, making dramatic discoveries about the planet and its moons. Neptune rotates once every 16.1 hours. While its blue color comes from the presence of methane gas, its atmosphere's most prevalent gases are hydrogen and helium. The weather on Neptune is extremely dynamic, with the fastest winds—up to 1,500 mph—detected on any planet. Like Jupiter, with its Great Red Spot, Neptune has an especially turbulent atmospheric storm—also large in diameter as the planet Earth—that scientists have dubbed the Great Dark Spot. Neptune’s planetary magnetism is unusual compared to that of Earth, whose magnetic pole is centered and closely aligned with its geographic pole. For reasons that are not yet understood, Neptune’s magnetic axis is steeply tilted (about 50°) in relation to its rotational axis. Just as puzzling is the fact that the magnetic field is considerably offset from the planet’s center. From afar, Neptune’s rings look like partial “ring arcs,” seemingly interrupted in places as they circled the planet. Data from Voyager revealed that the four major rings—probably, like those of Saturn and Uranus, composed partly of water ice and debris from the breakup of colliding small moons—seem interrupted because they vary in density and structure. One theory is that such uneven composition indicates an aging ring structure. Voyager 2 discovered six new Neptunian moons—three with very dark surfaces and irregularly shaped, the largest 250 miles in diameter—for a total of eight known satellites. The makeup of the planet’s rings has led to speculation that there may be more, smaller moons. Neptune’s largest moon, Triton, had first been seen in 1846, the same year Neptune was discovered. Like Saturn’s Titan and Jupiter’s Io, Triton has an atmosphere and a surface temperature (–391° F) that make it one of the Solar System’s coldest worlds. Geysers erupt with five-mile-high plumes of nitrogen and methane, and a pinkish-white polar cap composed of the same gases freezes and sublimes, its location shifting with the seasons. Neptune was Voyager’s last planetary stop in an odyssey that is planned to continue for another two decades. Its next mission is to explore interstellar space.		
cold-fusion	1989	Cold fusion	A method for achieving nuclear fusion at room temperature was proposed, promising transformative energy generation. The claims were later discredited due to replication failures and inconsistencies.	B. Stanley Pons, Martin Fleischmann	United States	stellarator	Science: Physics	For years researchers had looked for a feasible means of producing nuclear fusion, which occurs when atomic nuclei combine, releasing energy (see 1951, Stellarator). The problem was that the known methods of combining nuclei required great amounts of heat to initiate the reaction. Scientists had been trying to develop a way to contain the required heat, with no practical solutions yet reported. Since the March 23 announcement by American chemist B. Stanley Pons (b. 1943) and British chemist Martin Fleischmann (b. 1927),		
chiron-comet	1989	Chiron Comet	Chiron was observed to display comet-like characteristics as it neared the Sun. Turned out Chiron was a very large comet, with a nucleus 112 miles in diameter, more than 10x the size of Halley's comet.			chiron	Space	Chiron, initially considered an asteroid, displayed increasing brightness in 1987 as it neared the Sun, similar to comet behavior. In 1989, astronomers observed Chiron's coma, confirming its comet-like characteristics. It is a very large comet with a nucleus about 112 miles in diameter.		
genetic-medicine	1990	Genetic medicine	Researchers were starting to identify genes that, when defective, caused diseases like cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, etc. One successful therapy involved disarming a virus and inserting the normal genes into it, and this was done successfully on a four year old patient.	R. Michael Blaese, W. French Anderson	United States	virus-genome	Science: Medicine	In 1990 American physicians R. Michael Blaese (b. 1939) and W. French Anderson (b. 1936), working at the National Institutes of Health, conducted the first successful human gene therapy on a four-year-old girl who suffered from a genetic immune system disorder caused by the deficiency of a particular protein.		
hubble-space-telescope	1990	Hubble space telescope	The Hubble Space Telescope was launched to explore space with high precision and resolution, an unmanned 12 ton observatory set to space to avoid Earth's atmospheric blurring. Despite initial optical issues, it revolutionized space observations by capturing detailed images of stars, planets, and galaxies.	(NASA)	United States	100-inch-telescope, earth-resources-satellites, photography, space-shuttle	Space	HST was designed to explore phenomena such as the age of the universe and to capture images with unprecedented resolution. Despite a primary mirror flaw that limited initial operations, it provided images and data about stars, planets, and galaxies, pushing deeper into space exploration than ever before.		
fullerene-research	1991	Fullerene research	Fullerenes, including buckminsterfullerene (bucky balls), are a C60 object in the shape of a soccer ball with versatile potential uses from creating strong materials to acting as superconductors at relatively warm temperatures at 45°K. Questions remain about their toxicity and stability when exposed to air.	Richard Smalley	United States	warm-superconductivity	Science: Chemistry	Growing knowledge about a molecule postulated in 1985, isolated in 1990, and first imaged in 1991 led to a flood of research on buckminsterfullerene (the "buckyball," for short), a soccer-ball-shaped molecule named for the inventor of the geodesic dome, another structure it resembles. A third form of carbon—the others are diamond and graphite—the buckyball (C60) is a highly stable molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms in an arrangement of 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces. Its intriguing structure led chemists to suggest that, along with a related group of molecules called fullerenes, it may give rise to a whole new class of materials. Because fullerenes are highly resilient, they might be used to manufacture high-strength materials or super-hard coatings. Because they do not react with corrosive gases, they may also be excellent lubricants. Buckyballs readily absorb and release electrons, and so may be superior to the lead-acid battery for storing energy. Shaped into tiny tubes, they might act as electrical conductors. Other molecules can be encased within the buckyball’s spherical structure, so researchers are looking for ways to use it to deliver diagnostic or therapeutic chemicals to sites within the body. Similarly, this molecular storage unit could encapsulate radioactive substances or hold materials that store electronic information. One of the most exciting prospects for the fullerenes is their potential as warm superconductors (see 1987). With the addition of potassium or other metals to the buckyball structure, researchers have achieved superconductivity at temperatures as high as 45° K, above that at which the oxide ceramics superconduct. Despite the large amount of research that has been done on the fullerenes, important issues remain. There have been questions about their possible toxicity, an abundant natural source has not been found, and they are unstable when exposed to air.		
volcanic-venus	1991	Volcanic venus	The Magellan spacecraft successfully mapped over 90% of Venus's surface despite its challenging atmosphere. including mountains as high as 7 miles, craters up to 30 miles across, and gigantic volcanic domes, including lava flows as long as 125 miles.	(NASA)	United States	radar-mapping-of-venus	Space	By the end of 1991, the Venus orbiter Magellan, sent into space in May 1989, had completed mapping more than 90 percent of the planet’s surface. Scientists were familiar with the harsh atmosphere on Venus: mostly carbon dioxide, with a little nitrogen and sulfuric acid, at a pressure 90 times that on Earth and superheated to 900° F. Now Magellan’s powerful radar pierced this		
first-asteroid-photograph	1991	First asteroid photograph	The Galileo space probe photographed the asteroid 951 Gaspra, a 12 x 8 mile wide football shaped body with hundreds of meteorite craters in it. These were the first captured images of an asteroid in space.	(NASA)	United States	jupiter-probe	Space	On October 29, the Galileo space probe, sent into space in 1989 and on its way to a rendezvous with Jupiter in 1995, traveled within 1,000 miles of the asteroid 951 Gaspra and relayed the first black-and-white photographs ever taken of an asteroid in space. Gaspra orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Irregularly shaped—one astronomer said it looked like a dented football—Gaspra is marked with deep, criss-crossing grooves and heavily pitted with more than 600 meteorite craters; it is 12 miles long and 8 miles wide. Because of a defect in Galileo's antenna, photos taken the following year were three times sharper than the 1991 images, and in color.		
gamma-ray-bursts	1991	Gamma ray bursts	The Gamma Ray Observatory, launched aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, conducted the first survey of gamma-ray sources in the universe. This discovery advanced scientific understanding of powerful cosmic phenomena such as supernovas and black holes.	(NASA)	Space	space-shuttle	Space	While scanning the skies for violations of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in the 1970s, U.S. government detectors recorded bursts of gamma rays from outside the Solar System. Astronomers wanted to know more; as the most powerful type of radiation, gamma rays may be the first signals we receive from extremely distant heavenly bodies. In April 1991, the space shuttle Atlantis put the 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) into orbit 280 miles above Earth. Its mission was to make the first survey of gamma-ray sources throughout the universe and particularly to study such explosive energy sources as supernovas, quasars, neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes. Early data from GRO suggested that the flash-bulb-like bursts, which release more energy in a tenth of a second than the Sun releases in ten thousand years, resulted from collisions of neutron stars with comets, gas clouds, or other stars. After six months, however, the GRO		
background-microwave-radiation-experiment	1992	Background microwave radiation experiment	The satellite Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)'s sensitive instruments were anticipated to provide detailed measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation, necessary to provide experimental proof of the afterglow of the big bang. These findings supported the idea of an inflationary universe, and corroborated the theory of dark matter.	(NASA)	United States	inflationary-universe, background-microwave-radiation	Science: Cosmology	Gamow (see 1948) had first postulated and Penzias and Wilson (see 1964) had confirmed the existence of background microwave radiation, which permeates space as the afterglow of the big bang. But cosmogonists needed data on the makeup of the radiation to bolster theories about the formation of galaxies and other large structures in the Universe. Thus the scientific world eagerly awaited results from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), an American satellite launched in November 1989 into an orbit 560 miles above Earth, for COBE's instruments were 100 times more sensitive than previous devices. At first COBE reported that the background radiation was perfectly smooth.		
larger-role-rna	1992	Larger Role for RNA	At this point, cell scientists believed that RNA acted only as a messenger, and that proteins would carry out functional activities. Now RNA was shown to be capable of acting alone to string together amino acids, meaning that RNA was more important in protein synthesis than had been realized.	Harry Francis Noller	United States	transfer-rna	Science: Biology	In the spring of 1992, Harry Francis Noller demonstrated that RNA alone could string together amino acids, showing RNA's crucial role in protein synthesis, fundamental to life.		
very-long-baseline-array	1993	Very long baseline array	The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) is an astronomical instrument comprising ten radio telescopes spread over 5,000 miles, from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands. It produces highly detailed images, offering insights into galaxies 300 million ly away, as well as minute movements of the tectonic plates on Earth, for example that Europe is moving away from North America at 0.8 inches per year.	(NASA)	United States	hubble-space-telescope	Space	In late August, the world’s largest astronomical instrument began operating. Spread over 5,000 miles of U.S. territory, the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) uses an 82-foot dish at each of ten sites—from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands—to receive radio waves from deep space. Together, the ten dishes act as a single radio telescope, synchronized by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, New Mexico. The VLBA produces images with a resolution 500 times that of a perfectly functioning Hubble Space Telescope.		
fermats-last-theorem-proof	1993	Fermat's last theorem proof	Andrew Wiles successfully proved Fermat's Last Theorem using the Taniyama Conjecture related to number theory. His work brought closure to a centuries-old mathematical problem and introduced new mathematical techniques.	Andrew John Wiles	England	fermat-last-theorem	Math	A milestone seemed to have been reached when British mathematician Andrew John Wiles announced in July that he had established the truth of the famous theorem. While a year or two would be required for the 200-page proof to be thoroughly scrutinized and confirmed, Wiles's reputation was excellent, and on first review by his mathematical peers the proof was highly acclaimed. Wiles cracked the Fermat case by first solving a related math riddle central to number theory, the Taniyama Conjecture, which deals with elliptical curves. As part of the process of laying Fermat's 356-year-old problem to rest, Wiles also developed new techniques for dealing with important issues in number theory.
